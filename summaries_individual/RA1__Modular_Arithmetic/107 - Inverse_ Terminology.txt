X has an inverse mod N implies uniqueness. Inverse example: X=3, N=11, inverse is 4 since 3*4 â‰¡ 1 mod 11. Many equivalents to 4 mod 11 exist (e.g., 15, 26, -7), yet we define the inverse of X mod N as the smallest non-negative integer in the range 0 to N-1 for practicality. Inverse reported as "does not exist" if absent. Extended Euclid algorithm employed to find the inverses, occasionally necessitating additional steps to convert a negative output to the specified range.
