Goal to demonstrate Z^(P-1) ≡ 1 mod P. Examined sets S (1 to P-1) and S’ (S elements x Z mod P). Proved S and S’ identical, different orders. Multiplying S and S’ elements separately yields identical products mod P: S gives 1×2×...×(P-1), S’ yields Z×1, Z×2,..., Z×(P-1). Sides equal mod P, left is (P-1)! and right is Z^(P-1) × (P-1)!. As P is prime, each term 1 to P-1 has an inverse mod P. Multiplying by inverses cancels (P-1)!, results in Z^(P-1) ≡ 1 mod P, confirming the theorem.
