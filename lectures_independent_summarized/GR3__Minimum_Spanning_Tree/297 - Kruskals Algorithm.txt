Kruskal's algorithm addresses the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem for undirected, weighted graphs. Process: sort all edges by weight using an algorithm like merge sort; starting with the lightest edge, iteratively add edges to a set X, avoiding any that would form a cycle. The process continues until all edges are considered, with early ones being lightest and later ones heaviest. The resulting set X, once all edges have been considered without creating cycles, forms an MST.
