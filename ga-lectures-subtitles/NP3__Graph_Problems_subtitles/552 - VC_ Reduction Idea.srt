00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,790
 To get an idea for the reduction,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,655
 let's look at our earlier example of a vertex cover.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:07,745
 The red vertices are our vertex cover in this graph.

4
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:10,275
 What do you notice about the vertices that are not red?

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:14,165
 The white vertices. They form an independent set in this graph.

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:17,310
 Let's take a look at another example of a vertex cover.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,170
 There's a minimum sized vertex cover.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,580
 What do you notice about the white vertices in this graph?

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,200
 They also are an independent set in this graph.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
 We claim this holds in general as is a vertex cover in

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,975
 the graph if and only if S bar the complement of s is an independent set.

12
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:35,780
 So the red vertices are vertex cover and

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,550
 the non-red vertices are an independent set and vice versa.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,045
 Let's prove this claim and then the reduction from

15
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:42,045
 independent set to vertex cover will be straightforward.
