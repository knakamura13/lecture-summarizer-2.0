1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
 Now I misled you a little bit.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,150
 We're going to use a generalization of Fermat's little theorem called Euler's theorem.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,330
 So from this little theory as Gann says,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,190
 if P is a prime then for every Z between one and P minus one,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,310
 we take that Z raised to the power P minus one is congruent to

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,640
 1 mod P. Euler's theorem is going to generalize it

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,055
 to any number N here instead of

8
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:28,050
 just a prime number P. So Euler's theorem replaces P by any N,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,685
 not necessarily a prime number,

10
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:34,525
 and any Z but we need that Z and N are relatively prime to each other.

11
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,585
 By relatively prime, we mean that the GCD of Z and N is one.

12
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:41,940
 Now if Z and N are relatively prime to each other then we're

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,620
 going to perform an operation similar to Fermat's a little theorem.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,840
 So we're going to raise Z to the power phi of N,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,785
 I'll tell you what phi of N is in a second,

16
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,665
 and that's going to be congruent to one.

17
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,325
 Now what is this crazy phi of N?

18
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:01,750
 When N is a prime then phi of N is P minus one or N minus one.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,565
 In general, what does it phi of N?

20
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,645
 It's a number of integers between one and N

21
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,234
 which are relatively prime to N. So in other words,

22
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:14,100
 it's the size of the set of those Xs where X

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,360
 is between one and N and X is relatively prime to N,

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,660
 which means that the GCD of X and N is one,

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,330
 and we want to look at the cardinality of this set.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,075
 How many Xs between one and N,

27
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:32,160
 or N minus one, have GCD of one with N?

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,585
 This function phi of N is called Euler's totient function.

29
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:39,415
 Try to say that ten times quickly.

30
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,510
 So let's take a look at what Euler's totient function

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,975
 is for the case when N equals P is a prime number.

32
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,525
 For prime number P, what is phi of P?

33
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:54,560
 How many numbers between one and P are relatively prime to that prime number P?

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,395
 Well every number between one and P minus one, one, two, three,

35
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:01,320
 up to P minus one are all prime,

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,000
 relatively prime to P. So the number of relatively prime to P is P minus one.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,310
 So if you look at Euler's theorem for the case when N is

38
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,840
 a prime number P then we're raising Z to the power of P minus one,

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,860
 and that's congruent to one mod P. So it's exactly the same as Fermat's little theorem.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:19,860
 So Euler's theorem is a generalization of Fermat's little theorem to arbitrary N.
