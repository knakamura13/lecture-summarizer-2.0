Evaluated a polynomial A(x) at points x0 to xN-1 using lin algebra, now comparing with FFT perspective. nth roots of unity replace x points, x_j = ω_n^j where ω_n is nth root of unity. Vectors/matrices updated: A(1), A(ω_n)...A(ω_n^(n-1)). Coeff. vector of A(x) stays same. Matrix rows derived from powers of ω_n. First row all ones (powers of 1), second row powers of ω_n, mimicking nth roots of unity. Subsequent rows powers of ω_n^2...ω_n^(n-1). Matrix is symmetric (entry_ij = entry_ji) and only a function of ω_n, suggesting inherent matrix properties related to ω_n powers.
