1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
 Now, here's our specific two-SAT example from earlier,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,135
 and here's the graph corresponding to this Boolean formula.

3
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:10,445
 Let's take a look at this graph and explore some properties of it.

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:13,065
 Here's a particular path which is quite interesting.

5
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:16,850
 We go from X_1, we follow this edge to X_2-bar,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,900
 to X_3, and then we can follow it to X_1-bar.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,100
 So, we have this path which goes from X_1 and ends up at X_1-bar.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,745
 Now this is a path of implications.

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:29,820
 Each edge is an implication.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,895
 So, if we follow those implications out,

11
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,690
 so if we set X_1 to be true,

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,400
 we satisfy this literal,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
 then we're going to have to satisfy this literal.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,465
 How do we satisfy this literal?

15
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,685
 By setting X_1 to be false.

16
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,560
 So, if we set X_1 to be true,

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,450
 then in order to satisfy the formula,

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,425
 we have to set X_1 to be false.

19
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:49,515
 That's clearly a contradiction.

20
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:53,400
 So, there's no way we can satisfy the formula by setting X_1 to be true.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,070
 Now, what happens if we set X_1 to be false?

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,925
 Well, there are no edges out of X_1-bar.

23
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:02,370
 So, there are no implications from setting X_1 to be false.

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,010
 So, it might be okay. We don't know.

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,510
 We have to proceed with the other variables.

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,770
 All we know is that,

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,605
 because there is a path from X_1 to X_1-bar and clearly we cannot set X_1 to be true.

28
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:19,180
 Now, what if there was a path from X_1 to X_1-bar and from X_1-bar to X_1?

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,905
 Then we know that we can't set X_1 to be true,

30
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,800
 because that would lead to a contradiction,

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,660
 and we can't set X_1 to be false,

32
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,355
 because that would lead to a contradiction.

33
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,170
 So, there's no valid setting of X_1.

34
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,460
 There's no setting of X_1,

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,515
 which leads to a satisfying assignment.

36
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:36,010
 Therefore, we can conclude that F is not satisfiable.

37
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,265
 Now, we saw that if there is a path from X_1 to X_1-bar,

38
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,880
 then we can't set X_1 to be true.

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,635
 We cannot satisfy the formula by setting X_1 to be true.

40
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:49,515
 Similarly, suppose there's a path from X_1-bar to X_1,

41
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:52,430
 then we know that we can't set X_1 to be false.

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,685
 So now, suppose that there is a path from X_1 to X_1-bar

43
00:01:55,685 --> 00:02:00,505
 and also there's a path from X_1-bar to X_1,

44
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:01,975
 then what do we know about F?

45
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:07,405
 Well, we know we can't set X_1 to be true and we know that we can't set X_1 to be false.

46
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:09,700
 So in fact, there is no way to satisfy

47
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,535
 the formula F. What does this mean about the graph?

48
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:16,725
 If there is a path from X_1 to X_1-bar and from X_1-bar to X_1,

49
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:21,170
 that means that these two vertices are in the same strongly connected component.

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,720
 They're strongly connected with each other,

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,370
 so they're in the same SCC.

52
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,930
 So, if this literal and its negation are in the same SCC,

53
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,330
 then this formula is not satisfiable.

54
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,415
 And if this is true for any variable,

55
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:38,620
 the positive literal X_i and X_i-bar are in the same SCC,

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,705
 then the formula is not satisfiable.

57
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:44,085
 What we're going to see is that if this is not true.

58
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:46,015
 So, for every variable,

59
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:49,270
 the literal and its negation are in different SCCs.

60
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,855
 So, they never lie in the same SCC.

61
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:54,695
 Then, in fact, we're going to find a satisfying assignment.

62
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:54,695
 So, we're going to prove it satisfiable by finding a satisfying assignment.
