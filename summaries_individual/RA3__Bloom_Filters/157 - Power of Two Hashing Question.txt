Implementing a dictionary for unacceptable passwords utilizing dual hash functions, H1 and H2, which map elements into an n-sized hash table from a set U. These functions produce independent and random mappings. Insertion within this dual-hash system differs from a single hash function's straightforward approach, where an element is added to a linked list at a calculated hash value. The process of inserting with two hash functions H1 and H2 requires a new strategy, prompting a discussion on potential methods for efficient dictionary entry.
