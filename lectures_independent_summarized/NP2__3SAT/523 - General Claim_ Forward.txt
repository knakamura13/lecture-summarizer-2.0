Constructed a formula C with k literals and a related formula C' with k-2 clauses. Claimed C satisfiable iff C' satisfiable. Proved forward implication; an assignment satisfying C can be adjusted, using auxiliary variables, to satisfy C'. Satisfying a literal aᵢ in C ensures the (i-1)th clause in C' is satisfied. For earlier clauses in C', set auxiliary variables y₁ to yᵢ₋₂ to true. For later clauses, set auxiliary variables yᵢ₋₁ to yₖ₋₂ to false. Thus, if at least one literal in C is true, the corresponding adjustments to auxiliary variables ensure C' is also satisfied. The reverse implication remains to be demonstrated.
