The algorithm's runtime analysis shows that partitioning the vector 'a' into even and odd elements requires O(n). It uses recursive calls, each on a subvector of size n/2 for both even and odd elements. Computing the R's necessitates O(1) per pair, amounting to O(n) in total. The runtime recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) is satisfied, which resolves to O(n log n), establishing the efficiency of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.
