Dynamic programming (DP) is highly useful and a favorite teaching subject, yet initially challenging for students. Mastery requires practice, well beyond the provided homework. It's crucial to tackle additional problems from various sources. Starting with calculating Fibonacci numbers as a simple DP example, the course will cover a range of DP problems, including Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), the Knapsack Problem, Chain Matrix Multiplication, and shortest path algorithms using DP techniques.
