Developed dynamic programming algo to compute nth Fibonacci number. Algorithm uses an array F to store Fibonacci sequence, with base cases F[0]=0 and F[1]=1. Utilizes for loop from 2 to n, with each Fibonacci number being the sum of previous two stored values. Essential feature: no recursion used, despite recursive nature of Fibonacci formula. Running time analysis shows base cases require constant time, and the for loop iterates n times with a constant time operation within, resulting in a linear O(n) total run time for the algorithm. Algorithm showcases dynamic programming technique.
