00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
 Now let's give a quick overview of the type of algorithms for solving linear programs.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,349
 Now there are two types of methods which are guaranteed to solve

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:10,394
 linear programs in polynomial time in the worst case.

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:13,679
 These are the ellipsoid algorithm which was the first example of

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,120
 a polynomial time algorithm for linear programming and interior point methods.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,519
 Now ellipsoids algorithms are more of theoretical interest,

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,019
 but interior point methods are used quite extensively right now.

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,855
 Now an important algorithm is the simplex algorithm.

9
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,390
 As a disclaimer for the simplex algorithm is

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,125
 that in the worst case it takes exponential time.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,875
 Despite that worst case bound,

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,890
 simplex algorithm is widely used because the output of

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,740
 the simplex algorithm first off is guaranteed to be an optimal.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,829
 So when the simplex algorithm completes,

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,140
 it's guaranteed to give an optimal solution to

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,034
 the linear program and it works quite efficiently,

17
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:51,744
 very fast on a humongous LPs.

18
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:55,270
 There are very fast LP solvers using the simplex algorithm.

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,270
 We're going to take a look at the high level idea of the simplex algorithm.
