1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,145
 Now, here's a particular graph.

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:05,190
 Let's put some weights on these edges and then let's see how

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,720
 we would approach the MST problem using a greedy approach.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,400
 Now, let's give the edges of this cycle the smallest weight,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,665
 so we can focus on the behavior on this cycle.

6
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,620
 For the rest of the edges, I don't want to worry about so much.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,833
 So, let me give you a bunch of edges weight seven,

8
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,965
 and I'll give a bunch of edges weight nine,

9
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,310
 and the remaining edges I'll give weight 12.

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,740
 Now, most of the weights don't matter for this example.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,900
 I want to focus on this particular cycle.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,320
 So, really, the first six weights are the only ones that matter.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,455
 Now, let's look at how I would approach the MST problem from the greedy perspective.

14
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:39,550
 In the greedy approach, the first edge I would consider is the edge of weight one.

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,350
 I would start off with the empty graph.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,915
 So, my current MST is empty and I'm going to build up the MST one edge at a time.

17
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,280
 I'll consider the edges by increasing weight.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,070
 So, I'll start with the first edge of lowest weight,

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,580
 which is this edge of weight one.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,600
 Now, I'm going to add it in if I can.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,120
 Well, currently I have the empty graph as my current MST.

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,745
 And then, when I consider this edge of weight one, can I add it in?

23
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,600
 Yes, of course I can add it in because it doesn't create any cycles.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,535
 So, let's add it in. Then I consider the edge of weight two.

25
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:12,940
 Can add that in to my current MST?

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,600
 Yes, I can add it in because it doesn't create any cycles.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,445
 Similarly, for the edge of weight three,

28
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,815
 and edge of weight four, edge of weight five.

29
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,065
 Finally I consider the edge of weight six.

30
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,290
 Can I add that into my current MST?

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,485
 No, I cannot add this edge into my current MST because it creates a cycle.

32
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:36,200
 After that, I'll consider the edges of weight seven, in some order.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,540
 But both of these edges can get added in.

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,540
 And similarly, these other three edges of weight seven can also get added in.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,555
 Now, let me consider these other edges of weight nine.

36
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:48,150
 This edge I can add and without creating a cycle.

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,585
 Similarly this edge.

38
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:52,780
 Finally, when I consider this last I edge of weight nine.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,690
 Can I add it in without creating a cycle?

40
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,310
 We'll say the end points of this edge are V and

41
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,800
 W. Notice that V and W are already connected.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,795
 They lie in the same component.

43
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:13,800
 See, I have this path from V to W. So,

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,980
 since V and W lie on the same components, they are already connected.

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,260
 So, if I add an edge between them that creates

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,660
 another path and therefore I have a cycle which contains this edge.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,320
 So, I don't add in this edge.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,285
 And similarly any of the edges of weight 12 I don't add in.

49
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:28,285
 And this is in fact an MST of this graph.
