Alice desires to send an encrypted message M to Bob. She retrieves Bob's public key (N, E) and encrypts M by raising it to power E and then taking modulus N, resulting in the encrypted message Y. For this operation, Alice employs a fast modular exponentiation algorithm for efficiency. Upon receiving Y, Bob decrypts it using his private key D by raising Y to power D and taking modulus N to recover the original message M. The decryption works because D is chosen as the multiplicative inverse of E mod (P-1)(Q-1), where N equals PQ and P, Q are primes. Euler's theorem ensures this process succeeds when M and N are relatively prime (or share a prime factor). Bob's decryption process is more computationally intensive due to his large D value, thus necessitating the use of the fast modular exponentiation algorithm. The RSA algorithm relies on the generation of random prime numbers, P and Q, which underpin the security of the encryption; methods of prime verification are explored subsequently in the text.
