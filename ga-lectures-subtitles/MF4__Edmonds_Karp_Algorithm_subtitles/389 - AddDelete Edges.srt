1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,385
 Let's take a look in detail how the residual graph changes potentially in a round.

2
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:08,085
 Now, consider an edge of the original flow network.

3
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:11,160
 Now, this edge itself might be in the residual network or

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,580
 its back edge from w to v might be in the residual network.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,920
 Let's look at when the forward or backward edge might

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,525
 be added or removed from the residual network.

7
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,545
 When do we add this forward edge to the residual network?

8
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,680
 Well, in order to not be there before,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,530
 the flow had to be full.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,033
 So if the flow was full,

11
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,200
 so it means the flow equaled the capacity along that edge,

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,030
 and then the flow was reduced,

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,660
 then this edge would have leftover capacity.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,190
 So it would be added into the residual network.

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,880
 Now, how can the flow be reduced along this edge?

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,185
 That means we send flow along the back edge.

17
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,935
 To send flow along the back edge,

18
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:48,380
 that means the back edge was in the augmenting path cal-p.

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,365
 So if this forward edge was added into the residual network,

20
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:55,770
 then the back edge must have been on the augmenting path.

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,050
 Now, let's look at the other case where we remove

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,720
 this forward edge from the residual network.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,885
 Now, we will remove it if there was some leftover capacity,

24
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,005
 but now there's no leftover capacity.

25
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,110
 So the flow equals the capacity along this edge.

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,770
 That means we augmented the flow,

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,705
 increased the flow along this edge.

28
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,365
 So this forward edge itself is on the augmenting path.

29
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:21,450
 In order to remove this forward edge from v to w from the residual graph,

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,720
 then this forward edge from v to w must

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,260
 be on the augmenting path because we increased the flow along this edge.

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,290
 Now, the other type of edge that we can add into the residual network is

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,845
 the back edge from w to v. To add the back edge in,

34
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,430
 the flow must have been empty and then we increase the flow along

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,170
 the edge from v to w. To increase the flow from v to w,

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,840
 that means this edge from v to w must be on the augmenting path.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,540
 The final case is when we will remove the back edge from the residual network.

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,560
 Now, in order to remove this back edge from the residual network,

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,530
 there must have been some flow along the forward edge,

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,690
 and then the flow is now empty.

41
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,450
 So we must have decreased the flow along this forward edge.

42
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,180
 To decrease the flow along the forward edge,

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,845
 that means we send flow along the back edge.

44
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:05,845
 So the back edge from w to v must be on the augmenting path cal-P.
