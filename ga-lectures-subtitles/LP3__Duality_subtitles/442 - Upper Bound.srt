1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,305
 Here again is the LP that we're considering,

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:04,345
 and we're interested in this point 200,

3
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:06,900
 200, 100, which has profit.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,385
 The value of the objective function at this point is 2,400,

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,960
 and we're trying to verify that this is the optimal,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,180
 the maximum profit that we can achieve.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,890
 Now consider this vector Y.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,570
 It's got four coordinates,

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,090
 and we're considering the vector zero, one-third, one, eight-thirds.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,755
 Let's ignore how we got this vector Y for now,

11
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,445
 we'll address that later.

12
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,975
 Let's simply consider this vector for now.

13
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:34,930
 Now this vector has four dimensions because we have four constraints in this LP.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,230
 So this number, these constraints.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,935
 So X1 is the most 300,

16
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:41,160
 is the first constraint, and so on.

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,555
 The fourth constraint is X2 plus 3X3 is at most 500.

18
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:50,146
 Now we know any feasible point satisfies all four constraints,

19
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:53,760
 so it also satisfies any linear combination of these constraints.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,765
 So let's take the linear combination defined by Y.

21
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,845
 So we're going to look at Y1 times the first constraint,

22
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:02,120
 Y2 times the second constraint,

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,945
 plus Y3 times the third constraint,

24
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,195
 and Y4 times the fourth constraint.

25
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:07,590
 Let's go ahead and write this out.

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,030
 So this linear combination,

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,010
 this expression is equivalent to the following.

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,550
 As to Y1 times the first constraint.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,110
 So we get X1Y1 on the left hand side,

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,520
 and the right hand side we get 300 times Y1.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,050
 Now for the second constraint,

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,280
 X2Y2 on the left hand side,

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,915
 and 200Y2 on the right hand side.

34
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:27,855
 Now let's use the third constraint.

35
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:36,435
 The left hand side has X1 times Y3 plus 3X2Y3 plus 2X3Y3.

36
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:40,315
 And the right hand side has 1000Y3.

37
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:47,590
 And finally the fourth constraint gives us X2 times Y4 plus 3X3 times Y4,

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,235
 on the left hand side,.then we get 500Y4,

39
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:52,549
 on the right hand side.

40
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:59,610
 Now we know that any feasible point X satisfies this inequality for any non-negative Y.

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,090
 If Y happens to have negative coordinates,

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,065
 then we have to worry about flipping the sign.

43
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:06,730
 But assuming Y is non-negative,

44
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,215
 then this inequality is satisfied by any feasible X.

45
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,500
 Now before we plug in our specific Y,

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,070
 let's collect terms and simplify this expression slightly.

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,285
 What are the X1 terms?

48
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,425
 Well we have a Y1 and a Y3.

49
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:21,870
 Now what are X2 terms?

50
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,690
 Well we have a Y2, 3Y3 and Y4.

51
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,140
 And lastly, what are the X3 terms?

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,890
 We have a 2Y3 and 3Y4.

53
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,555
 That completes the left hand side.

54
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,655
 The right hand side stays the same.

55
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:41,900
 So we have 300Y1 plus 200Y2 plus 1000Y3 plus 500Y4.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,635
 Now finally, let's plug in the specific Y which we chose.

57
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:49,440
 So the coefficient of X1 is zero plus one, so it's one.

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,180
 So we get X1.

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,155
 For X2, we get one third plus eight thirds plus three.

60
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:58,793
 So we get 6X2.

61
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:02,650
 For X3, we get two plus eight, so we get 10X3.

62
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,815
 And the right hand side when you plug it in,

63
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:07,560
 it computes to 2,400.

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,360
 Now notice that the left hand side is exactly the objective function of the original LP.

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,625
 And we proved that this objective function is at most 2,400.

66
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,960
 So we've shown that any feasible X,

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,990
 the value of the objective function is at most 2,400.

68
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,420
 Therefore, the maximum profit that we can achieve is at most

69
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,760
 2,400 and we have a point which achieves this profit.

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:32,760
 Therefore this point is optimal.
