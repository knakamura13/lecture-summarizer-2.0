1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
 Now a cut of the graph is a partition of the vertices and two sets.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,320
 We will think of these two sets as the left side and the right side.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,905
 So we denote it as L and R. Then we are going to be looking at st-cuts.

4
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:14,075
 These are a particular type of cuts.

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:18,720
 This is the cut which separates S from T. So S is on one side,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,040
 let's say the left side,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,820
 and T is in the right side.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,175
 Now here's our example of a flow network that we looked at earlier.

9
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,280
 Let's mark an example of an st-cut in this graph.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,470
 Here's an example of an st-cut.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,405
 We put these four vertices S, A,

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:39,055
 B and F in the set L. Notice this set doesn't have to be a connected set.

13
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:42,270
 F is not connected to A and B in this subset.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,530
 And the set R are the remaining four vertices, C,

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,650
 D, E and T. Now we're going to be interested in the capacity of this st-cut.

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,475
 What exactly is the capacity?

17
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,220
 Recall is a directed graph.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,135
 We're going to look at these directed edges

19
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:02,040
 VW where V is in the left side and W was in the right side.

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,800
 So these are all edges which go from the set L

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,455
 to the set R and we're going to look at the capacity of these edges.

22
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:11,040
 So we're looking at the total capacity of edges from

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,780
 the set L to R. But we're not looking at edges from R to L. So we're

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,210
 looking at sum of the capacities of these six edges which exit L. Notice that

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:21,210
 these edges such as C to F which go into L do not count in this count.
