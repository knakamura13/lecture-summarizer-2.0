1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
 Now we can formalize our reduction from SAT to 3SAT.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,389
 So let's consider our input formula for the satisfiability problem.

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,775
 And let's create an input formula for the 3SAT problem,

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,525
 by the following procedure.

5
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,160
 Let's consider the clauses of f one by one.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,225
 So, for clause C in f,

7
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,290
 we'll have two cases depending on whether the clauses of size are most three,

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,180
 or strictly bigger than three.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,460
 If C contains at most three literals,

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,420
 then we can add this clause as is to this new formula.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,890
 Now what if C contains more than three literals?

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,550
 Then we have to use our previous construction.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,885
 In this case, we create k-3 new variables as we said before,

14
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:44,345
 and we replace C by this new formula C prime,

15
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,830
 this sequence of k-2 clauses,

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,570
 as we defined before.

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,800
 So, small clauses stay the same,

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,195
 big clauses are replaced by k-2 new clauses,

19
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,025
 as we defined before.

20
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,440
 Now that we've defined the input to the 3SAT problem,

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,105
 now we have to prove that this original input to the SAT problem is satisfiable,

22
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:09,910
 f is satisfiable if and only if its input to the 3SAT formula f prime, is satisfiable.

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,145
 So f is satisfiable,

24
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:13,510
 if and only if f prime is satisfiable.

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,510
 Now this statement is quite straightforward to prove,

26
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,195
 given that we've already proven that C is satisfiable,

27
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,670
 if and only if C prime is satisfiable.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,920
 Then afterwards, the remaining task is to

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,080
 show that given a satisfying assignment to f prime,

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,045
 we can construct a satisfying assignment to f. That again will be straightforward,

31
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:33,510
 because we just ignore these auxiliary variables and the setting for

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,510
 the original variables will give us a satisfying assignment to the original form-
