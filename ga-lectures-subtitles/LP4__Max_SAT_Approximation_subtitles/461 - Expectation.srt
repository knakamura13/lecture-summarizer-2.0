1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
 Once again capital W denotes a number of satisfied clauses for a random assignment.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,875
 Each variable is assigned true or false with probability one half.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,740
 Now, we want to look at a simpler quantity.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,830
 In particular, we want to look at one clause in isolation.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,545
 So, consider the J's clause.

6
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:19,930
 C sub J, and let's make a new random variable W sub J.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,653
 Now, we're just talking about one clause,

8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:23,730
 so either that clause is satisfied or not.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,695
 Therefore, this new random variable is going to take either value 1 or 0.

10
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,270
 It takes value 1 if the clause CJ is

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,070
 satisfied and it takes value 0 if it's not satisfied.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,250
 Now, what happens if we sum this quantity over all clauses?

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,590
 So, we look at the sum for J going from 1 to M of W sub J,

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,650
 where we get a 1 for every clause which is satisfied and 0 if it's not satisfied.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,210
 So, this gives us a total count of the number of satisfied clauses.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,128
 Therefore, it's equal to capital W. Now recall,

17
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,030
 our original goal was to analyze the expected of performance of the algorithm.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,070
 So we want to look at the expectation of capital W,

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,210
 expected number of satisfied clauses.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,890
 Now, we can plug in this identity,

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,995
 so we can replace capital W by this sum.

22
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:11,160
 We have the expectation of the sum over J of

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,535
 W sub J and now recall the new rarety or expectation.

24
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,468
 So, we can take the sum outside.

25
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:20,058
 The expectation of two random variables X and Y.

26
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:26,245
 Expectation of X plus Y is the same as expectation of X plus the expectation of Y.

27
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:33,390
 So, now we have that the expectation of W equals the sum over J of the expectation of WJ.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,630
 Now, we can analyze this quantity expectation of WJ.

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,480
 Notice, this just depends on the clause CJ.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,830
 It doesn't have anything to do with the other clauses.

31
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,815
 So, now we can focus on this clause in isolation.

32
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:44,815
 We don't have to look at any of the other clauses.
