Now, the solution is one_over_n_to_the_log_n. Why is that? Let's look at it more closely. Take a particular ball j. What is the probability that this ball is assigned to this particular bin Bi? Well, the ball is going to a randomly chosen bin, so the chance of going to any particular bin is one_over_n. Therefore, the first ball has probability one_over_n of being assigned to bin Bi. The second ball, same, has a probability one_over_n of being assigned to bin Bi, and so on for all these log_n balls. So the probability that all of them are assigned to bin Bi is the product of one_over_n, for each. So, the total probability is one_over_n raised to the power log.
