Now one last point about the cut property. There's another algorithm, Prim's algorithm. Prim's algorithm is for Minimum Spanning Tree problem. And is very similar to Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path. Now to make sure you understand the cut property, you should use it to prove correctness of Prim's algorithm. Make sure you understand why Prim's algorithm is correct, by using the cut property.
