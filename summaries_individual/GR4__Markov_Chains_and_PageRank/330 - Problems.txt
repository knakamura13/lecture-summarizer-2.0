Random walks on web graphs aim to define PageRank by reaching a stationary distribution regardless of starting points. Key concerns include whether there's a unique distribution and handling multiple strongly connected components, which could bias PageRank. Ensuring a unique stationary distribution requires a fully connected graph, eliminating strong components and periodicity by adding edges—even with low probabilities—between all vertices. This models a realistic browsing scenario where users might randomly jump to any webpage with equal likelihood, maintaining connectivity and fairness in the distribution used to calculate PageRank.
