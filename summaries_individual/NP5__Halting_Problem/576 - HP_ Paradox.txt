Developed a new program called "Harmful" which challenges the hypothetical "Terminator" algorithm, purportedly able to solve the halting problem. Harmful accepts an input J. It uses the Terminator to evaluate if the pair (J, J) will halt. Terminator's true outcome induces a loop in Harmful (directly referencing Dijkstra's critique on the GoTo statement), whereas a false result terminates Harmful. This construction aims to illustrate that if such a universal halting-problem solver (Terminator) existed, Harmful would lead to a contradiction, thus demonstrating the failure of Terminator.
