1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
 Let's summarize and recap the previous example.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,600
 So, this was the original LP.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,725
 We had three variables and four constraints.

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:12,163
 Our new LP, the dual LP had four variables: y1, y2, y3, and y4.

5
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:21,200
 The objective function was to minimize 300y1 plus 200y2 plus 1000y3 plus 500y4.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,365
 This was the right hand side of the linear combination of these constraints.

7
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:29,210
 First constraints, so that y1 plus y3 is at least one.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,020
 This gave us a coefficient of at least one on the left hand side.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,680
 y2 plus 3y3 plus y4 is at least six.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,725
 We took the constraints containing x2 that the final left hand side

11
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,990
 and the right hand side was from this coefficient

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,500
 of this objective function in the original LP.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,490
 The third constraint was 2y3 plus 3y4 is at least 10.

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,490
 And finally we needed that the y's were non-negative.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,890
 Now, a feasible x here, achieved this profit.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,460
 So any feasible x gives us a lower bound on the profit that we can achieve.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,665
 It actually shows an example where you can achieve that profit.

18
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,190
 Now, in this dual LP,

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:12,745
 any feasible y gives an upper bound on the profit that we can achieve in the original LP.

20
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,385
 Now, this new LP is called the dual LP.

21
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,424
 The original LP in order to give it a name,

22
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:18,424
 it's referred to as the primal LP.
