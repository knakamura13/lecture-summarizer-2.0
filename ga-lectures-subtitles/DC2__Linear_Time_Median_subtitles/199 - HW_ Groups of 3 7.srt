1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,590
 Now a natural question is,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,170
 why do we break A into these groups of five elements each?

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,850
 Why did we choose five?

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,790
 What would have happened if we would have broken into

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,895
 n over three groups of size three elements each,

6
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:15,330
 or n over seven groups of seven elements each?

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,070
 This is nice homework question to make sure you

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,275
 understand the analysis of this algorithm.

9
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:23,554
 So consider groups of size three each and seven each,

10
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,980
 and look at the analysis of the algorithm.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,555
 What is the recurrence in these cases where we break into groups of three or seven?

12
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:34,815
 Write down the recurrence and see whether that recurrence solves to order n or not,

13
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:34,815
 and that'll show you why we consider groups of size five.
