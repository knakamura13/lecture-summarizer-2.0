Let's look at an important consequence of dilemma we just stated on the previous slide. Given a flow network, so an input to the Max-flow problem, and given a particular flow F, what is the time required to check whether this particular flow F is a Max-flow or not? Specify your answer in big O notation, in terms of N, the number of vertices in the flow network, and M, the number of edges in the flow network.
