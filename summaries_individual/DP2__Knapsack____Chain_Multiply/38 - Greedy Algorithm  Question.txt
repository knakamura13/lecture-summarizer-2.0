Greedy approach's pitfalls demonstrated using an example with four objects for a problem where the goal is to find the optimal solution that maximizes value without exceeding total capacity of 22. Objects values: 15, 10, 8, 1. Weights: 15, 12, 10, 5. Only one copy of each object can be used. The challenge is to identify the subset of objects that achieves maximum value while fitting within the backpack's capacity constraint.
