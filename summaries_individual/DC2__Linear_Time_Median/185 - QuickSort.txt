Adopting a divide and conquer strategy similar to quicksort for solving a problem. Quicksort involves choosing a pivot and partitioning an array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. Quicksort then recursively sorts the lesser and greater elements, ultimately combining them. Choosing an effective pivot, ideally the median, is critical as a poor choice leads to inefficient O(n^2) performance. The goal is to improve on quicksort's O(n log n) by only recursively processing one partition. The challenge lies in selecting an appropriate pivot to achieve O(n) time complexity.
