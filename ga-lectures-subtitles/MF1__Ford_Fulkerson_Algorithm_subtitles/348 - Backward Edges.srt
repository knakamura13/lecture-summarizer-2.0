1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
 Now what are we missing in this graph of available capacities?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,425
 Well, if we reverse engineer a little bit and we look at the optimal solution,

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:11,050
 we see that we want to augment along this path.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,440
 So we'd like to augment the current flow along this path from s to b,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,010
 b to a and a to t. In this way,

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,215
 we want to increase the flow along this edge,

7
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,083
 s to b, in this edge,

8
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,910
 a to t, to seven.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,195
 But what does it mean to augment along this edge from b to a?

10
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,840
 There's no such edge in this flow network.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,300
 We'll think about this as a pipe.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,290
 So when we send flow along this edge,

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,835
 a to b, we're opening up faucet.

14
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,770
 So we're sending more flow along this pipe.

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,410
 If we send flow from b to a,

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,300
 it's like we're closing the faucet,

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,310
 so we're sending less flow from a to b.

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,130
 The point is that this graph of available capacities is not properly

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,730
 representing everything that's possible to do from this current flow.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,210
 In particular, we want to send an edge from b to a,

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,020
 and this edge should have available capacity 10. Why 10?

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,185
 Because the current flow from a to b is 10 units.

23
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:17,636
 So, if we send at most 10 units of flow from b to a,

24
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:21,855
 that corresponds to decreasing the flow from a to b.

25
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:23,495
 Now if we look at this graph,

26
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,600
 this is no longer the graph of available capacities.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,785
 This graph is called the residual network.

28
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:32,405
 And in this graph, we can find a path from s to t. Namely,

29
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:34,250
 we can find this path that we're looking for,

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:42,470
 you go s to b, b to a and a to t. The capacity of this path is seven units.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,135
 So we can augment the flow by seven units along this path.

32
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:50,060
 So the flow from s to b will change to seven units,

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,960
 we'll send seven units from b to a by decreasing the flow from a to b by seven units,

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,040
 so it will go down from 10 to three.

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,150
 And from a to t,

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,765
 the flow will increase by seven units.

37
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07,820
 And then, we'll be at a Max-flow for this example.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,290
 So the key idea is to look at

39
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:09,290
 the residual network instead of the network of available capacities.
