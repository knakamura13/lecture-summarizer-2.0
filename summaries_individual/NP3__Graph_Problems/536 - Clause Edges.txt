Two edge types in graphs represent clauses and variables. Clause edges encode clauses by linking literals in complete subgraphs—a triangle for three literals, an edge for two, and a singleton for one. An independent set S in such a graph can contain only one vertex per clause, representing the satisfied literal for that clause. Achieving an independent set of size m aligns with finding a satisfying assignment for a formula, as exactly one literal per clause must be satisfied. However, a conflict arises when an independent set includes complementary literals, like x_1 and x_1 bar, yielding an assignment where x_1 is both true and false—a contradiction. Thus, independent sets must be constructed to avoid simultaneously assigning both true and false to the same variable, ensuring they represent valid assignments.
