00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,095
 The Max-flow-min-cut theorem states that for any flow network,

2
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:09,010
 the size of the max-flow equals the minimum capacity of an st-cut.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,975
 Just a quick note about notation here.

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:13,995
 We keep calling this an st-cut to distinguish that

5
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:17,725
 s is on one side of the cut and t is on the other side of the cut.

6
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:21,555
 Notice s and t are also implicit in this max-flow formulation.

7
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,020
 We could have called it a max st flow because we're sending the flow

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,560
 from s to t. Now in the max-flow problem,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,510
 it's clear there must be a start vertex s and an end vertex t. In a min-cut problem,

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,020
 there doesn't necessarily have to be an s and t that you're separating.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,710
 We could instead look at the min-cut overall without looking at

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,735
 whether we separate s and t. So that's why we include the s and t in this formulation.

13
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:50,815
 So we called it the min st-cut problem to differentiate it from the min-cut problem.

14
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:54,630
 Now, let's dive into the proof of this min-cut max-flow theorem.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,300
 First, we're going to prove that the size of the max-flow

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,420
 is the most the minimum capacity of an st-cut.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,120
 And then, we'll prove the reverse inequality.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,650
 So we'll prove that the max-flow is at least the minimum capacity of an st-cut.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,525
 Once we prove both inequalities,

20
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,315
 then we've proved equality, and then we're done.

21
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:13,920
 To prove this inequality,

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
 what we'll show is that for any flow and any st-cut (L,

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,500
 R), the size of this flow is at most the capacity of this cut.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,105
 Notice that this simpler result will imply this inequality. Why is that the case?

25
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,385
 Well, this is true for any flow f,

26
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:33,630
 so we might as well take a max-flow and it's still true.

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,400
 So if we maximize over f,

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,955
 the size of f is still at most the capacity of this cut.

29
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:43,740
 And since the right hand side holds for any st-cut,

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,740
 we might as well take the cut of smallest size.

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,920
 So for the right hand side we can choose any cut we want.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,010
 So we'll choose the cut of minimum capacity,

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,280
 and then we have that the max-flow size is the most the min st-cut capacity.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,570
 So that shows the max-flow is the most of min st-cut.

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,710
 So we proved this inequality.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,765
 So we have a much simpler task now.

37
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:10,585
 We can forget about the max-flow and the min cut.

38
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:12,585
 We simply have to take any flow f,

39
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:18,345
 and any st-cut and show that the size of this flow is at most the capacity of this cut.

40
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,880
 And we don't have to worry anything about showing that

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:20,880
 this flow is optimal or this cut is optimal.
