00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,615
 The running time with the algorithm we just described as order n time capital b.

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:06,205
 The question I'd like to ask is that is

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:08,490
 an efficient algorithm or not? What do we mean by efficient?

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,900
 By efficient, we typically mean polynomial time.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,040
 What do we mean by polynomial?

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,550
 We mean polynomial in the input size.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,230
 So, is this running time of this algorithm that we just

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,195
 described is a polynomial in the input size?

9
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,805
 So I'll let you answer, yes or no?

10
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,305
 Is it polynomial in the input size,

11
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:28,435
 the running time of our argument we just described?

12
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:33,870
 And if it's no, I want you to detail exactly why is it not polynomial in the input size,

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,750
 and detail what exactly would it mean to be polynomial in the input size?

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,260
 What would be the requirement on

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,260
 the running time for it to be polynomial in the input size?
