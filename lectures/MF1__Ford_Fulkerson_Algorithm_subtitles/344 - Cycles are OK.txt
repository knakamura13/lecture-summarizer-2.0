Now, one interesting feature of this example, is that there is a cycle in this graph. There's a cycle that goes from C to F, to E, to D and back to C. Now, this is a cycle in the original input graph in the flow network. Now, we've seen for some other examples such a shortest path problem that cycles in the input graph can cause some issues. In that formulation, it's negative weight cycles which cause problems. So a natural question is whether cycles are okay in a flow network for the max flow problem. Notice that a flow network has a cycle but our flow, our maximum flow is not utilizing this cycle. And why is it not utilizing this cycle? Well, suppose that I had one unit of flow coming into D and then I send one unit flow along this entire cycle back to T and then send that one unit out of D. Well, I could just send it right from this edge into D and then out of D directly without going around the cycle so I could have bypassed the cycle. So there's no reason to utilize a cycle in a flow network. Now I may want to utilize part of this cycle and I don't know a priority which part of the cycle I might want to utilize. So the main conclusion is that cycles are okay in a flow network. In fact they simplify the problem in some sense but the problem is well-defined regardless of whether there are cycles in the flow network or not.
