1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
 We have an n-bit number r,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,950
 and here's our simple algorithm for checking whether r is

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,340
 prime or not based on Fermat's Little Theorem.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,315
 And this is ignoring Carmichael numbers,

5
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:14,340
 it will be an efficient algorithm for primality testing.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,340
 Recall, that if r is composite then,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,220
 at least half these numbers in this set are

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,580
 witnesses to that fact using Fermat's Little Theorem.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,485
 Whereas, if r is prime,

10
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:30,570
 then none of these numbers in this set are witnesses to the fact because r is prime.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,890
 So, what are we going to do?

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,465
 We're going to choose a Z from this set.

13
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,610
 How do we choose a Z from this set?

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,890
 Well, we choose a Z randomly,

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,545
 uniformly at random from this set.

16
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:43,530
 So, we choose a random number between one and r_minus_one.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,385
 Now, we do Fermat's Test for this Z.

18
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:47,880
 So, we compute Z raised to

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,565
 the power r_minus_one_mod_r and we check whether that's congruent to one, or not.

20
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:58,855
 If Z raised to the power r_minus_one is congruent to one_mod_r then what do we know?

21
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,630
 Actually, we don't know for sure either way,

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,750
 but we think that r is prime.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,257
 What happens if Z raised to r_minus_one is not congruent to one_mod_r?

24
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,870
 Then, in this case we're sure that r is composite

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,870
 because this Z is a witness to the fact that r is composite.
