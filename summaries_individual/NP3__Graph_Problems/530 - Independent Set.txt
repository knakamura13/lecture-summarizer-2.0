Independent set defined as subset of vertices in undirected graph G with no edges among them. The check involves ensuring no vertices in subset are adjacent. Finding large independent sets is challenging, whereas identifying small or trivial ones, like an empty set or single vertex, is simple. Example provided with a graph where a set of three vertices represents an independent set, illustrating the concept.
