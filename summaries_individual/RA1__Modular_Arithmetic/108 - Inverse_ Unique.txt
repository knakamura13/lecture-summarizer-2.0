In mathematical terms, if an inverse of X modulo N (X inverse mod N) exists, it is proven to be unique within the set of integers from 0 to N-1. To establish this uniqueness, a proof by contradiction is employed, beginning with the assumption that X has two distinct inverses mod N, denoted by Y and Z. When both Y and Z are multiplied by X, the congruence to 1 mod N confirms their status as inverses. Multiplying both sides of the equation XY ≡ XZ (mod N) by the hypothetical inverse of X cancels out X, leaving Y ≡ Z (mod N), which contradicts the original assumption that Y and Z are distinct mod N. This contradiction implies that X can only have one inverse modulo N when it exists. Further exploration will cover the conditions for the existence of an inverse mod N; specifically, an inverse exists when X and N are coprime—where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of X and N is 1. This future explanation includes using the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse under this condition. Conversely, if X and N share a common factor (the GCD of X and N is greater than one), the inverse of X mod N does not exist.
