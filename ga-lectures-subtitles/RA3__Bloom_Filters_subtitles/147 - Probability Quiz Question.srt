00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 Let's take a short probability quiz to give a quick refresher on some basic probability.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,660
 Let's look at what is the probability,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,275
 that the first log and balls are assigned to bin bi for a particular i.

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,400
 We want to look at the probability that the first log and

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,075
 balls are assigned to this particular bi.

6
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:17,075
 Go ahead, and write the quantity here.
