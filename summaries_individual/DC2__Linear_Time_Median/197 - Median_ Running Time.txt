To demonstrate P as a good pivot, the running time of the algorithm was analyzed step-by-step. Breaking array A into groups of n/5 takes linear time, O(n). Sorting each five-element group is constant time, O(1), thus sorting all groups is O(n). The median of medians algorithm recursively runs on a subset S (N/5 size), taking T(N/5) time. Partitioning A into three subsets and recursing on one takes O(n) and is bounded by 3/4N. The recurrence relationship considering 3/4N, N/5 for the median of S, and additional O(n) operations shows the sum is less than one, resulting in a linear time complexity, O(n), for the algorithm. Ensuring P is a good pivot is pivotal for the algorithmâ€™s completion.
