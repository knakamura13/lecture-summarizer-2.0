Exploring a variant of the knapsack problem which permits an unlimited number of each object to be used, contrasting the previous single-use object constraint. Same dynamic programming approach applied; the subproblem definition modified to accommodate multisets of objects (allowing for repeated use) rather than subsets (single use). The subproblem K(i,b) focuses on maximizing value with objects 1 through i but now without the one-time-use restriction, considering the total weight limit b.
