1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,735
 Now we know that f is feasible. What does that mean?

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:06,330
 That means that the flow along this edge E is at least its demand.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,565
 Now f-prime along this edge E is defined to be f along this edge minus the demand.

4
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:14,040
 So since this is true,

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,515
 we have the flow f-prime along this edge is at least zero.

6
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:20,280
 So f-prime is non-negative.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,790
 Similarly, we have that f is at most its capacity.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,580
 Therefore, f-prime is at most the capacity minus

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,560
 the demand which is the definition of the capacity in this network G-prime.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,485
 So we know that this new flow f-prime that we constructed

11
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:38,295
 is non-negative and satisfies the capacity constraints.

12
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,020
 Now we simply have to check that

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,020
 f-prime satisfies the flow in equals the flow out constraint.
