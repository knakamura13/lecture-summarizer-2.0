The random surfer model, defining web navigation behavior, is ergodic when alpha (α), the probability of following a link, is less than one. This stipulation ensures a non-zero probability of moving from any page to another directly in a step, signified by the transition matrix P having all positive entries. Ergodicity hinges on the addition of a complete graph to the original web graph G, creating an augmented graph G-prime. This model allows for a random jump to any page, not solely through existing links. The degree to which α is less than one impacts how closely G-prime's PageRank vector, the principle eigenvector, reflects the properties of G. A higher α, approaching one, suggests G-prime closely resembles the original web graph, implying the PageRank vector for G-prime could represent the characteristics of G accurately. Conversely, a lower α indicates G-prime is moving away from G, yet this leads to a faster convergence rate toward the PageRank vector due to the greater influence of the complete graph. Google's choice of α at 0.85 balances resemblance to G (thus relevance of the PageRank result) and efficient convergence. Investigating the effects of varying α on the PageRank vector can reveal how the set and ordering of top-ranked sites shift with this parameter. Analyzing data with different α values, especially contrasting those close to one with 0.85 or 0.75, will illustrate these effects on the web page rankings.
