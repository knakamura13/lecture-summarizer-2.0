1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,395
 We had this linear algebraic view of FFT.

2
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:05,640
 Now let's simplify it a little bit.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,300
 This column vector is just the vector a.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,315
 Let's denote this column vector by capital A.

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,563
 And let's denote this matrix by M,

6
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:19,200
 let's use subscript n to denote its size M by n. And as we observed,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,535
 it's simply a function of omega sub n. So given this variable,

8
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:26,325
 and this size, then we know it's M by n,

9
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:28,755
 and it says powers of this variable,

10
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:31,320
 in this case omega sub n. Therefore,

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,335
 this expression can be rewritten in the following manner.

12
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:41,110
 This vector capital A is equal to this matrix capital M times this vector little a.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,490
 This product is exactly what FFT is computing.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,285
 When we run FFT with inputs little a and omega sub n,

15
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:56,595
 it computes the product of this matrix and this vector and outputs this vector capital A,

16
00:00:56,595 --> 00:01:00,545
 which is the value of this polynomial at the nth root of unity.

17
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:03,090
 Now what do we want to do for inverse FFT?

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,670
 Now we want to take this value of this polynomial at

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,310
 these nth roots of unity and compute the coefficients.

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,940
 Well, suppose this matrix has an inverse and we multiply both sides by this inverse.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,753
 Well, then we have that the inverse of this matrix times this vector,

22
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:21,110
 capital A, equals this vector little A.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,350
 So FFT computes this product,

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,455
 this matrix M times this vector, little a.

25
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:29,340
 For inverse FFT, we want to compute the inverse of

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,780
 this matrix times this vector, capital A.

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,420
 How does this inverse of this matrix relate to the original matrix?

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,420
 Well, actually they're very similar to each other.
