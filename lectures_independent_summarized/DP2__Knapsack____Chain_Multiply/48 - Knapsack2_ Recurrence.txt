Defined a recurrence relation for a knapsack problem variant allowing unlimited copies of an item. Explored scenarios of either including an additional copy of item i or not. If not included, the resulting subproblem is K(i-1, b). If included, value v_i is added and the capacity decreases by w_i, but unlike the original problem, index i remains instead of decreasing to i-1, enabling reuse of item i. Validated the recurrence by ensuring subproblems are smaller and solvable with previously completed entries. For entries requiring a capacity less than the item's weight, the item can't be included. Running time to fill an n x b table is still O(nB), with each entry computed in constant time.
