To make sure you understand what's involved in proving that a problem is in the class NP, let's take a short quiz. The max independent set problem is in the class NP. Is that statement true or false? To be more precise, let's change this statement slightly. So let's say the max independent set problem is known to be in the class NP. Is that statement true or false? I added this qualification, known to be, because there are scenarios such as P equals NP that would change things. So this will be the standard form for our true false questions of this type.
