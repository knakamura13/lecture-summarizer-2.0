A key concept that we're going to need for the RSA algorithm are multiplicative inverses. Now the concept is a bit subtle for a modular arithmetic. Let's go back and look at the normal, real numbers and see what multiplicative inverses mean there. If we take a number three, what's its multiplicative inverse, it's one third. And so if we look at three times one third what do we get? We got one. And in general for a number a, it's multiplicative inverse is one_over_a. And, when we multiply those two together what do we get? One. Now we're going to have a number z and we want to look at its inverse mod N. So we want to know what one_over_z_mod_N is. So we're going to define it as the number, so that when we do z_times_one_over_z we get back one. So our definition of the inverse of z_mod_N, this is number x, so that if we do x_times_z, we get one_mod_N. In this case x is the inverse, it's one_over_z_mod_N. And the notation is that x is z_to_the_negative_one, same as one over Z. So x is z_to_the_negative_one_mod_N. So x is the multiplicative inverse of z_mod_N. Notice also, that if x is the inverse of z_mod_N, then z is the inverse of x_mod_N, because x_times_Z is one_mod_N. So, x is the inverse of z and z is the inverse of x_mod_N. Now let's go ahead and look at a specific example to make sure this notion of multiplicative inverse modulo N makes sense.
