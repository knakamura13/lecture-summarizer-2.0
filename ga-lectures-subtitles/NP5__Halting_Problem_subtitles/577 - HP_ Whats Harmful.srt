1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
 Let's detail once again what's happening in this simple program.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,870
 We're running Terminator on input J,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,370
 J. What does that do?

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,165
 That runs program J on input J,

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:18,390
 and Terminator returns true if program J on input J terminates. It eventually halts.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,430
 And it returns false if J on input J never terminates.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,260
 It has an infinite loop.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,835
 So there are two cases,

9
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:28,440
 either Terminator of J,

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,495
 J returns true or false.

11
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:34,690
 In which case, we either go to the THEN statement or the ELSE statement.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,160
 Now, if program J on input J terminates so we get a true,

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,055
 then in this case, what happens in the program?

14
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:48,015
 So we go to the THEN statement and we have a GOTO(1) and then we have an infinite loop.

15
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:52,395
 So in this case, Harmful of J never terminates. It has an infinite loop.

16
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:54,583
 Because if terminator of J,

17
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:59,130
 J returns true, then we go to one and we have this loop.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,380
 In the other case, if we get false,

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,425
 then we go to the ELSE statement and we exit the program right away.

20
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:05,425
 So Harmful of J terminates.
