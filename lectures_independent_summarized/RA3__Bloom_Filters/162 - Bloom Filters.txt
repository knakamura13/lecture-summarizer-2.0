Bloom filter is a binary array of size n, initialized with all zeros. To insert an element, compute its hash and set the corresponding array bit to one. Bits transition only from zero to one, preventing easy deletions and enabling only insertions. To query if an element is in the set, check if its hash-indexed bit is one; if so, it might be in the set, leading to possible false positives when distinct elements share a hash value. Improvement can be made by using multiple hash functions; initially two, but later generalizing to k hash functions to optimize performance. The optimal number of hash functions, k, will be determined to enhance the structure's robustness.
