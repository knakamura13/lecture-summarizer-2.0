1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 This is false. Just like with the knapsack problem,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,895
 this is not polynomial in the input size.

3
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:08,053
 To be polynomial in the input size,

4
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:08,053
 the running time would have the N times polynomial in log t.
