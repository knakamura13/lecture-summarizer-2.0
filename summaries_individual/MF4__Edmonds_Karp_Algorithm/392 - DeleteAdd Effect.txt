The lemma addresses how the levels of vertices change when an edge is deleted and then added back into a residual network, specifically regarding vertex v and its neighbor w. If an edge from v to w is deleted, it implies that w's level is one more than v's level at the time of deletion. When the edge is reintroduced, v's level must then be one more than w's. Since v's level doesn't decrease and w's level was at least i+1 earlier, reintroducing the edge ensures v's level is at least i+2. In essence, deleting and re-adding an edge to the network causes the associated vertex level to increase by at least two.
