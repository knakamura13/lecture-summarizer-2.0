The knapsack problem involves selecting a subset of n items, each with an integer weight (w1 to wn) and value (v1 to vn), so their combined weight does not exceed a given capacity (B), while maximizing their total value. The challenge seeks an optimal solution that balances a limited capacity with the greatest possible value gain. This problem is similar to job scheduling with limited resources, aiming for optimal job selection based on value. It serves as an introductory example for dynamic programming techniques, with further applications and variants explored in subsequent homework assignments.
