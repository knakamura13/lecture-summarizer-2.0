Alpha, denoted ZJ hat star, correlates with clause CJ satisfaction probability, which is at least 1 - (1 - 1/alpha/K)^K. Transforming this from exponential to linear in alpha, define F(alpha) to equal the above. We claim F(alpha) >= some constant * alpha, where constant is 1 - (1 - 1/K)^K, independent of alpha but dependent on K, clause size. To prove this claim, establish F(alpha)'s concavity via its negative second derivative. Concavity ensures if F(alpha) > beta-alpha (a linear function where beta equals the constant) at alpha=0 and alpha=1, it exceeds it at all 0<alpha<1. Checking end points confirms the relation, with alpha=0 yielding 0, and alpha=1 easily verified. Thus, turned the original probability function linear in alpha.
