Proving bidirectional satisfiability between an original clause of size 4 (C_2) and a new pair of clauses of size at most 3 (C'_2). Forward direction: given a satisfying assignment for C_2, consisting of x_2, x_3, x_1, x_4, one of these must be true: x_2 = false, x_3 = true, x_1 = false, or x_4 = false. Two cases align with C'_2 clauses: 1) If x_2 = false or x_3 = true, set y = false, satisfying both new clauses. 2) If x_1 = false or x_4 = false, set y = true, also satisfying both C'_2 clauses. Therefore, a satisfying assignment for C_2 can be used to construct a satisfying assignment for C'_2, proving the clauses are satisfiable in the forward direction.
