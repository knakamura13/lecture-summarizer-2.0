Transforming a feasible flow problem (FFP) into a max flow problem (MFP) by modifying a directed graph G into G prime. In the example provided, graph G has four vertices with edges labeled with pairs of numbers indicating demand and capacity, respectively. Graph G prime is created by retaining G and adding vertices, including a new source (s prime) and sink (t prime); original source (s) and sink (t) become internal vertices. Edge capacities in G prime, denoted C prime, reflect both original capacities and demands from G. The construction of edges and capacities in G prime is not detailed but is crucial for solving the MFP based on the given FFP input.
