1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,246
 Now let's go ahead and restate the LP we just formulated.

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:06,974
 Our objective function was to maximize X_1 plus 6_x_2.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,480
 Recall, this was a profit we obtained.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,964
 Now,this was subject to the following constraints.

5
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:16,274
 First off, the demand for X_1 product A was at most 300 units.

6
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:18,960
 For Product B the demand was at most 200 units,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
 so X_2 is at most 200.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,085
 We need it to ensure that these variables are non-negative.

9
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:26,289
 Finally, we have the supply constraint.

10
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,295
 Now let's look at this problem geometrically.

11
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:32,640
 For now let's ignore the objective function and let's look at the five constraints.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,630
 Now each of these five constraints is a half plane.

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,640
 If it was equality, it would be a line,

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,780
 but we're doing one side of the line.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,954
 So, this gives us a half plane.

16
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,710
 Now note, we're in two dimensions because we have two variables.

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,729
 Now we want to satisfy all five constraints,

18
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,134
 so we want to look at the intersection of these five half planes.

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,649
 The intersection of these five a half planes is going to give us a set of feasible X.

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,820
 A set of X which satisfy all five constraints and then we're going to

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,525
 look in that feasible set to find the X which maximizes this objective function.

22
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:04,525
 So let's first look at this feasible region.
