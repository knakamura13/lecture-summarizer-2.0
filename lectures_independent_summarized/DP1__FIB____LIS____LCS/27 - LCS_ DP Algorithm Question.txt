Developed a dynamic programming algorithm to solve for longest common subsequence (LCS) given two input strings, X and Y. Initialized the top row and the first column of the LCS matrix with zeros, representing base cases. The matrix is filled row by row, considering two main cases: matching last characters of X and Y leading to a recurrence that adds 1 to the value of the subproblem for strings X and Y minus their last characters, or differing last characters, leading to a recurrence that takes the maximum value between dropping the last character from either X or Y. Final result, the LCS length, is found in the matrix's bottom right entry, L(n, n), which represents the LCS for the entire strings X and Y.
