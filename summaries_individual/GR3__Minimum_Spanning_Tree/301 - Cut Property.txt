The cut property lemma asserts that if you're constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST) for an undirected graph, by adding edges incrementally to a partial solution 'X' that is assumed to be a subset of a true MST 'T', then choosing the minimum weight edge 'E star' that crosses a cut—where one side of the cut is the subset 'S' and the other is its complement 'S bar', and no edge of 'X' yet crosses the cut—will allow this edge to be added to 'X' maintaining its correctness as part of an MST. This conclusion applies even if 'E star' leads to a different MST than the one initially considered 'T', because the objective is to find any MST, not a specific one. Using this approach and choosing edges in such a manner ensures the MST-building process is on the correct path.
