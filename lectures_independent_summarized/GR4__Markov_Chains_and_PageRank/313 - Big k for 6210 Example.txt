Observing powers of a transition matrix P for a Markov chain, specifically P raised to large exponents (e.g., P^10, P^20), reveals an intriguing property: all rows approach the same values, signifying convergence to a common row vector. This pattern of convergence is consistent across all rows and more pronounced at higher powers of P (e.g., P^20). Such an entry in the transition matrix signifies the probability of moving from any given stage at time zero to a specific stage at a chosen future time (e.g., time 20). This probability stabilizes and becomes independent of the initial state as time increases, indicating all states will eventually have the same probability of being in a particular stage at a large time scale. This property demonstrates the time independence of future states in large timescales for Markov chains, suggesting that the system's future state does not depend on its initial state.
