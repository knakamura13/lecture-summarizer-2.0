00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
 Now our main lemma bounds the number of

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,335
 times that we can delete an edge and then add it back in.

3
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:07,770
 Let's look at the effect of deleting an edge and

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,770
 adding it back in on the level of the vertices.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,395
 Let's take a particular vertex v and let's say the current level of this vertex v is i.

6
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:18,660
 Now suppose at some later round we delete this edge

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,335
 from v to this vertex w from the residual network.

8
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:27,445
 What can we conclude about the level vertex w when we delete this edge from v to w?

9
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,945
 Now if we were deleting this edge from v to w from the residual network,

10
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,085
 what do we know about the augmenting path?

11
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,855
 We know this edge itself from v to w is on the augmenting path.

12
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:41,250
 That means the level(w) is the level(v)+1.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,560
 Now at the time that we deleted this edge,

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,840
 the level(v) might have changed from the earlier time,

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,145
 so might not be level i anymore.

16
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,145
 But what do we know about the level vertex v?

17
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:54,895
 We just prove that the level(v) never decreases.

18
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:59,350
 So this level(v) at this current time must be at least i.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,555
 So this is at least i+1.

20
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:05,760
 So the level(w) at this time is at least i+1.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,740
 Now suppose later we add this edge from v to w back into the residual network.

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,265
 Now if we're adding this edge from v to w into the residual network,

23
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:16,135
 then we know that the reverse direction edge,

24
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:19,740
 the edge from w to v must be on the augmenting path.

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,480
 Therefore, at this current time,

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,475
 the level(v) must be equal to the level(w)+1.

27
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:30,240
 By our claim, we know that the level(w) did not decrease from

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,570
 earlier times and we earlier showed that the level(w) was at level at least i+1.

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,090
 So this is that level at least i+2.

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,450
 Notice what we just proved.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,240
 Suppose the level(v) is i,

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,380
 now we take an edge going out from vertex v,

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,130
 and we delete that edge and later we added it back in.

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,590
 After we added this edge back in,

35
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,070
 we know that the level of the vertex is at least two greater than what it previously was.

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,070
 So the level of this vertex increased by at least two.
