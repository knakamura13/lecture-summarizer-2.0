Examining a variant of the shortest path prob., different from previous Bellman-Ford single source to all vertices. Now, considering all pairs shortest paths in a directed graph with pos. or neg. edge weights. Defined dist y, z as the length of the shortest path from y to z, expanding to include all vertex pairs. Goal is to find shortest paths for all NÂ² vertex pairs. A straightforward method to address this all pairs shortest path challenge is to apply Bellman-Ford algorithm N times, each with a different starting vertex, covering all vertex combinations.
