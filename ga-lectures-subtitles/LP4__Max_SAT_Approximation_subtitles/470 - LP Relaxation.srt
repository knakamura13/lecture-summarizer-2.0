1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
 Take this ILP, this interlinear program that we just defined,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,245
 and consider an optimal point for this ILP.

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:10,785
 Of course we don't know how to find this optimal point in polynomial time,

4
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:12,765
 and we're not in fact finding it.

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:16,800
 We're just considering this optimal point for the purposes of the proof.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,070
 So let Y-star and Z-star denote the optimal point for this ILP.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,750
 Now what's the value of the objective function at the optimal point?

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,490
 Where the value of the objective function is simply the sum of the Z-stars.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,545
 What do we know about the value of the objective function at this optimal point?

10
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:37,830
 Well it equals M-star, what is M-star?

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,169
 M-star is the maximum number of satisfied clauses in the original formula

12
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:48,270
 F. M-star is what we're trying to find and we can't solve this ILP in polynomial time,

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,565
 but we can solve any linear program in polynomial time.

14
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:55,950
 Can we convert this ILP into a similar LP?

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,195
 While this last constraint is what makes this an ILP so let's drop this last constraint.

16
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:05,353
 So, now the feasible points are no longer constrained to be integer value

17
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:07,920
 and then this changes from an ILP to

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,875
 a linear program this is simply a linear program now.

19
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,815
 We can solve this linear program in polynomial time,

20
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:19,580
 and let's denote the solution to this linear program instead of by Y-star and Z-star,

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,295
 let's put the-hat there.

22
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:27,453
 So, Y-hat-star and Z-hat-star are the optimal solution to this linear program,

23
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,250
 these points we can find.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,865
 What's the relation between the objective function for the linear program

25
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:37,280
 compared to the ILP objective function at the optimal point?

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,460
 Where the value of the objective function for this LP at this optimal point,

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,380
 is the sum of the Z-hat-stars. How do these compare?

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,220
 Well any feasible point for the ILP is also a feasible point for the LP.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,800
 Because the ILP constrains it to lie in this grid,

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,215
 the LP considers any point.

31
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:59,930
 So, the LP is considered more points so,

32
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,570
 since the ILP optimal point is also feasible for the LP,

33
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,700
 and the optimal solution for the LP is

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,060
 at least as good as the optimal solution for the ILP.

35
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,405
 So, we know that this is the objective function value,

36
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:19,885
 is at least this objective function value for the ILP optimal solution.

37
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:22,500
 So, we can find upper bound on the maximum number of

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,680
 satisfied clauses in F. Does that do us any good?

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,380
 Well not necessarily, that doesn't help us find M-star in any way.

40
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,440
 What we're going to do now, is we're going to convert

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,200
 this LP optimal solution into a feasible point for the ILP.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,865
 It may not be an optimal solution to the ILP but it will be feasible.

43
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,145
 How do we do this?

44
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:48,560
 Will we have to convert this LP solution into a point on the grid.

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,470
 The simplest way to do that is to convert these fractional points

46
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,160
 these Y-hat-stars to integer points by rounding them to the nearest integer point,

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,260
 and we're going to do this in a probabilistic way.

48
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,185
 Now once we round these to integer points then we have a valid true false assignment for

49
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:10,800
 our set input F. And then we're going to

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,955
 prove that this rounded integer point is not that far,

51
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:18,760
 not that much worse than the original LP solution,

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,000
 than the fractional solution.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,253
 And since this fractional solution is at least as good as the optimal integer solution,

54
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,115
 then we know that the integer solution that we found

55
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:32,790
 is not that far off from the optimal integer solution.

56
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,180
 So, we're going to take this LP solution around it,

57
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,045
 that'll get worse than this optimal solution,

58
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:43,140
 we will show that this integer solution that we find is

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,140
 not far off from this fractional solution.
