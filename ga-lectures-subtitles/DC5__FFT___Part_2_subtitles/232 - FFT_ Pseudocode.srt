1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,130
 Now we can detail the pseudocode for the FFT algorithm.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,285
 Now, the first input is vector A,

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,870
 which are the coefficients for this polynomial A(x),

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,530
 and we're assuming that n is a power of two.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,745
 What is this second input? This Omega?

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,075
 Omega is an nth root of unity.

7
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:19,680
 For now, just think of Omega as Omega_sub_n.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,290
 In polar coordinates, this is 1,

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,640
 2 pi over n. And using Euler's formula,

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,370
 this is e to the two pi i over n. For now,

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,480
 you can view Omega as Omega_sub_n.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,610
 But later, we're going to use this exact same algorithm.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,950
 This is identical pseudocode with a different Omega.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,470
 We're going to use Omega as Omega_sub_n to the n - first power.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,005
 And that's going to allow us to do inverse FFT.

16
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,870
 In inverse FFT, we're going from the value of

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,070
 the polynomial at n points to the coefficients.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,710
 Now, what's the output of the FFT algorithm?

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,655
 Well it's the value of the polynomial at the nth roots of unity.

20
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,806
 If Omega is Omega_sub_n,

21
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,900
 what are the nth roots of unity?

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,865
 Well it's just the powers of this.

23
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,710
 So, the output is a evaluated at Omega to the zero,

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,915
 a evaluated at Omega,

25
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,609
 a of Omega squared,

26
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:18,025
 and so on, up to a at Omega to the n - first power.

27
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,330
 When Omega equals Omega_sub_n,

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,330
 this gives a evaluated at the nth roots of unity.
