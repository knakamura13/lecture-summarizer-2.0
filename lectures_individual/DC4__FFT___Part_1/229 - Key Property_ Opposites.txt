There are two key properties of the nth roots of unity which we're going to utilize. The first holes for even n, the nth root satisfies the plus minus property. This was the key property for our divide and conquer approach. The first n over two of the nth roots of unity are opposite of the last n over two. In other words, omega sub n to the zero power equals negative omega sub n to the n over two. And in general, omega sub n to the jth power equals negative omega sub n to the n over two plus j. So the nth roots of unity look like a perfect choice for our divide and conquer approach, because they satisfy the plus minus property.
