Our next dynamic programming example is Longest Common Subsequence. Which we'll use the shorthand LCS. The input to the problem is two strings, which will denote as X and Y. And for simplicity, for now, we'll keep them both of the same length. Our goal is to find the length of the longest string which appears as a subsequence in both X and Y, and notice that we're trying to find the subsequence, not a sub-string, and which simply trying to output the length of the string. And if we can find the length, we can use that to find an actual string which appears as a subsequence and we'll see how to do that at the end.
