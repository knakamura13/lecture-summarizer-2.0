Linear programming (LP) efficiently solves optimization problems by optimizing a set of variables within linear constraints towards an objective function. Both max flow and various operations research problems can be expressed as LPs. The simplex algorithm, a prevalent solution method for LPs, will be detailed. LP duality, a key feature of LP, offers valuable insights and applications, including its utilization in developing approximation algorithms, such as one for the set cover problem.
