Examining proof of a code property in graph theory. Consider graph G and a subset of edges x that are part of a minimum spanning tree (MST) T, marked in green. The set x is part of MST T, but exact edges of T are unknown. Define set S of vertices creating a cut that x doesn't cross. Goal is to show existence of a minimal spanning tree T' that includes both x and a minimum weight edge e* crossing the cut between S and its complement S bar. Any edge e* selected must have minimum weight across the cut, equal to or less than other edges crossing the cut. Construct T' by modifying T to include e* while retaining x, thus creating a new MST equal in weight to T. This demonstrates that combining x with e* maintains the MST property, keeping the total weight minimal.
