1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
 Now we're going to take this flow network,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,380
 and we're going to run the max-flow on it.

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,725
 We're going to get a flow of maximum size,

4
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:11,050
 and we know that the size of the maximum flow equals the capacity the minimum S, T cut.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,275
 Now let's try to understand S, T cuts.

6
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,995
 For a particular partition F,

7
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:17,076
 B, what is the capacity of that cut?

8
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,750
 Recall the capacity of this cut,

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,905
 and the capacity of the edges that go from F to B.

10
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,680
 So which S go from F to B?

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,520
 Recall we only get these edges that go from F to B.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,657
 We don't get the edges that go from B to F.

13
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:31,585
 So let's define a partition or cut in this graph.

14
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:34,815
 Let's suppose that these four pixels get assigned to the foreground.

15
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:37,875
 So this is our set F, and the remaining five,

16
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,530
 six vertices are in the background B.

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,240
 Now which edge is cross from F to B?

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,290
 Now consider one of these four pixels in the foreground.

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,735
 Notice its edge to T, crosses this cut.

20
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,260
 So we get this edge from I to T,

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,505
 and what's the capacity of this edge? It's B, I.

22
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:57,140
 That was our definition of this flow network.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,850
 Similarly, look at these pixels assigned to the background.

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,470
 For each of these five pixels,

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,025
 we get the edge from S to that pixel,

26
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,630
 and that edge from S originates in F,

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,490
 and ends in B.

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,075
 So it crosses this cut from F to B.

29
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:14,370
 And what's the capacity of this edge from S to this pixel?

30
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,465
 And that was defined to be F, J.

31
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:18,630
 Finally, for each of these separated edges,

32
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,310
 we get the edge in one direction,

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,610
 but not the other direction.

34
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,850
 We get this edge, this edge,

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,370
 this edge, and this edge.

36
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,865
 But notice we don't get the other direction edge.

37
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:31,960
 So for each edge in the original undirected graph,

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,260
 if I is assigned to the foreground,

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,345
 and J is assigned to the background,

40
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,605
 then we get the edge from I to J,

41
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,035
 and the capacity is P, I, J.

42
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,950
 Now if you sum up these terms, what do you get?

43
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,695
 That's the capacity of this cut, F, B.

44
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:48,750
 And that's exactly equal to W prime of F, B.

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,090
 That was our definition of W prime.

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,285
 We summed over pixels in the foreground of B,

47
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,053
 I. Pixels in the background of F,

48
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:59,785
 J, and the separation penalty. That's great.

49
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:03,155
 Our capacity is exactly equal to the quantity W prime,

50
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,835
 and our goal was to minimize W prime.

51
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,875
 If we run max-flow,

52
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,005
 we find a mins S, T cut.

53
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,965
 That's a cut with minimum capacity.

54
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:15,225
 So, we found the cut,

55
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:15,225
 the partition which minimizes W prime.
