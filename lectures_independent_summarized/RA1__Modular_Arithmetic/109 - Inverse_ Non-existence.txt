Multiplicative inverses for a number X mod N do not exist when X and N share a common divisor greater than one, demonstrated by the impossibility of an even number X having an inverse mod an even N due to the resulting paradox of equating an even product with an odd number. Inverses do exist when X and N are relatively prime, with their greatest common divisor (GCD) being one. To ascertain the existence of an inverse and calculate it, the Euclidean algorithm is used to find the GCD of X and N. If the GCD is one, the extended Euclidean algorithm can then find the inverse of X mod N, thus proving its existence.
