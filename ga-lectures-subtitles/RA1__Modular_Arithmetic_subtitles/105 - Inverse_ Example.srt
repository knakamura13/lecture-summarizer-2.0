1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 So, let's take the example where capital N is

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,755
 14 and let's look at the inverses of the numbers one through 13,

3
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:09,840
 mod N. Starting with X equals one.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,905
 So, what is the inverse of one mod N 14?

5
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:20,605
 What is the number so that one times that number is one mod 14?

6
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,645
 Well, One times itself is one.

7
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:26,885
 So, the inverse of one is one itself. It a self inverse.

8
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,430
 And that's always the case. One is always itself inverse.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,210
 Let's do a non-trivial case where x equals two.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,565
 What's the inverse of two mod 14?

11
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:38,820
 What number times two is congruent to one mod 14?

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,070
 Well, actually there is no number where that's the case.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,925
 So, the inverse of two mod 14, does not exist.

14
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,505
 Let's try X equals three. What's the inverse of three mod 14?

15
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:58,215
 Well, notice three times five is 15 which is one, mod 14.

16
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:00,875
 So, the inverse of three is five.

17
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,720
 And the inverse of five is three mod 14.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,230
 What about X equals four?

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,005
 What's the inverse of for a mod 14?

20
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:12,860
 Once again, just like the case of X equals two, that doesn't exist.

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,150
 What about X equals five? We already solve that.

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,433
 Its inverse three.

23
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,210
 How about six, seven and eight?

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,495
 Actually, none of those have an inverse mod 14. What about nine?

25
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:25,890
 What's the inverse of nine mod 14?

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,285
 This is 11 because nine times 11 is 99 and 14 times seven is 98.

27
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:36,000
 So, nine times 11 is one mod 14.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,305
 The last one is, what about 13?

29
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:41,385
 What's the inverse of 13 mod 14?

30
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,505
 It turns out it is a self inverse. It's 13 itself.

31
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,920
 13 times 13 is one mod 14.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,160
 All the other cases the inverse doesn't exist.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,740
 When exactly does the inverse exist or not?

34
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,920
 What is the key fact about when the inverse exists or not?

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,640
 When two, four and six. Those are all even numbers.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,350
 And 14 is an even number.

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,980
 So, they all have a common divisor too.

38
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,540
 Okay. What about seven?

39
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,775
 Well, seven is not even but it shares a common divisor with 14, seven.

40
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,350
 So, that's the key property.

41
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,340
 They share a common divisor.

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,890
 Then there is no inverse.

43
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,805
 But if they have no common divisor and in which sense,

44
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:24,645
 which case they're feel like primes relative to each other,

45
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,640
 then there is an inverse.

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,640
 So, one, three, five, nine and 13 have no common divisor with 14.
