Aiming to select a subset S from set A that approximates A's median; S’s median mediates the elements well, with each of its members (like X) having at least two elements from A that are both ≤ X and ≥ X. By partitioning A into groups of five (assuming N, the number of elements in A, is a power of five for clean partitioning), we can isolate N/5 representatives by selecting the median from each group. These medians concurrently represent their groups and the larger set A, ensuring S aptly mirrors A's makeup. To find a suitable pivot for array A to utilize in algorithms, perform the following: divide A into groups of five, sort each—sorting takes constant time due to the small group size—select medians as reps. The aggregate of these N/5 medians forms S. The median of S is then found recursively, serving as the pivot for A. We'll present the algorithm's pseudo code and substantiate both the pivot's effectiveness and the algorithm's runtime.
