1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,685
 Let's look at this problem from a completely different perspective.

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:09,820
 So we have the web graph G. The vertices are web pages and the edges are the hyperlinks.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,095
 These are directed edges.

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,120
 Now let's do a random walk on this graph.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,290
 What exactly does that mean?

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,130
 It's just like you're surfing the web.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,315
 So you write a web page,

8
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,925
 you're going to follow a random hyperlink from that web page,

9
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,220
 go to the next web page,

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,700
 look at it for a second,

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,890
 hit a random hyperlink and so on.

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,080
 So we started at some web page say we're currently at web page X.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,885
 Then let's choose a random hyperlink,

14
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:35,280
 so uniformly at random from all hyperlinks on this web page X and then we follow

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,560
 that hyperlink and then we repeat the procedure from the new web page.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,455
 This is a random walk on the directed graph.

17
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:47,680
 From a vertex, we're choosing a random outgoing edge.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,775
 So this is the Markov chain.

19
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,410
 What's the transition matrix for this Markov chain?

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,205
 Well for Web page Y has a hyperlink to a web page X,

21
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:59,895
 so there's a direct edge from Y to X in this web graph.

22
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:03,270
 Then the weight of this edge or in the transition matrix,

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,685
 this entry YX is one over the number of out neighbors from Y.

24
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:11,670
 The probability of following this particular link when we're at

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,930
 web page Y is exactly one over the number of links at web page Y.

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,050
 So if Y has a thousand links and

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,440
 the probability of following this particular link is one over X.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,840
 And if web page Y doesn't have a link to web page X,

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,690
 so there's no edge and this transition matrix is zero at that entry,

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,350
 so this defines the transition matrix for this Markov chain.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,220
 Now this is the Markov chain.

32
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,200
 So it has a stationary distribution.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,200
 What does this stationary distribution look like?
