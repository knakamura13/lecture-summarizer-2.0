00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 Before we explore inverse FFT,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,875
 it will be useful to explore the linear algebraic view of FFT.

3
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:11,060
 In this way, we can look at FFT as multiplication of matrices and vectors.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,885
 So consider a point x_j.

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:17,310
 The polynomial A of X evaluated at the point x_j equals a_0

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,065
 plus a_1 x_j plus a_2 x_j squared and so on.

7
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:27,170
 The last term is a_n-1 x_j to the n-1.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,140
 Notice that this quantity can be rewritten as the inner product of two vectors.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,740
 The first vector are the powers of x_j.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,030
 And the second vector are the coefficients for this polynomial A of X.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,230
 Now, FFT is evaluating this polynomial A of X and endpoints.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,190
 So let's look at this linear algebra view for the endpoints.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,810
 Now we're evaluating this polynomial A of X at these endpoints.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,760
 So we're computing A of_x_0,

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,225
 A of x_1 and so on up to A_of_Xn-1.

16
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:02,725
 The rows of this matrix would correspond to the powers of these points x_0 through Xn-1.

17
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:04,420
 We'll fill that in a second.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,150
 But first what is this vector?

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,750
 This vector are the coefficients of the polynomial A of X.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,110
 Now, filling in the rows of this matrix.

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,230
 The first row are the powers of x_0,

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,490
 and then the powers of X1.

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,490
 And finally, we have the powers of Xn-1.
