Our plan now is to prove that the 3SAT problem is NP-complete. What we just saw is that if we have a problem such as SAT, which is known to be NP-complete, then this makes our task much easier. So, we're going to use the fact that SAT is NP-complete. This is known as a Cook-Levin-Theorem. It was proved independently in 1971 by Steven Cook and Leonid Levin. And they proved that SAT is NP-complete. Now, we're going to take this theorem for granted. And later, I'll give you some high-level idea of the proof that the SAT problem is NP-complete. Now, after Steven Cook published his paper, then the importance of NP-completeness was highlighted by a paper by Dick Karp in 1972. He showed 21 other problems which were NP-complete. We're going to look at a few of these 21 in the next few lectures. We'll start with 3SAT, which was one of the 21
