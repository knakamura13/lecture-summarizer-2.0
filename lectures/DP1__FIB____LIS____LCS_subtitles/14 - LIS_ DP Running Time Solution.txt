We have one for loop, which varies over order n elements, and we have another nested for loop, which varies over, at most, n elements. Within these two nested for loops, we have a if-then statement, which takes order one time. Therefore, the total time for these nested for loops is, order n-squared time. Finally, we have another for loop which finds a max entry in the table. This is one for loop, it's not nested, this is order n time. Therefore, the total run time of our algorithm is order n-squared time.
