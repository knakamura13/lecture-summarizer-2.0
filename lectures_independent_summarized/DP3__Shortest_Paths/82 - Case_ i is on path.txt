Developing a recurrence for D(i, s, t) considering i is on the shortest path from s to t, using only vertices 1 through i as intermediates. The path includes four segments: from s to a subset of vertices 1 to i-1, around that subset, through vertex i, and back through a subset of vertices 1 to i-1 to t. The subsets may be empty or include all vertices in that range. The goal is to express D(i, s, t) by segmenting the path into these parts, which simplifies creating the recurrence.
