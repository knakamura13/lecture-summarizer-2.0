00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
 Let's discuss the geometry of linear programs.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,490
 Consider a linear program in standard form.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,550
 Let's say, that there are N variables.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,885
 So, X is a column vector of size N. And let's let M denote the number of constraints.

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,390
 As we discussed earlier, the feasible region,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,345
 the set of axes which satisfy these constrains,

7
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:20,055
 forms a convex set.

8
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:23,918
 Each constraint defines a half space in N dimensions.

9
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:27,585
 The set a points satisfying all M constraints are in

10
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:31,975
 the intersection of these M half spaces defined by the constraints.

11
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:35,340
 So, this forms a convex polyhedron in N dimensions.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,705
 We illustrated the simplex algorithm on our earlier example and recall

13
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,430
 that the simplex algorithm is walking on

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,520
 the vertices or the corners of this feasible region.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,870
 Now, the key point is that since this feasible region is convex, the optimum,

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,975
 the points maximizing this objective function,

17
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:55,620
 are going to be achieved at vertices of the feasible region.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,850
 Now, that's not always true.

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:56,850
 So, let's explore exactly when it is true.
