1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
 Finally, let's take a look at the writing time.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,735
 We have this one for loop,

3
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:05,727
 which is a size order of capital B.

4
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:08,580
 Then, we have a nested for loop inside,

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,805
 it's of size order N. Each step,

6
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,350
 in this nested for loop,

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,920
 takes order one time.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,145
 Therefore, the total run time is,

9
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:18,454
 order N times capital B.

10
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:23,130
 It's the same run-time as the original solution we had to this version.

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,242
 The space is smaller,

12
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,235
 and also it's simpler solution.

13
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,560
 It's a very simple algorithm,

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:28,560
 just a one dimensional table.
