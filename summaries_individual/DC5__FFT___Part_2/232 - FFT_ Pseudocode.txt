FFT algorithm pseudocode outlines processing a polynomial A(x) represented by vector A's coefficients, with n as a power of two. Omega acts as an nth root of unity, expressed in polar coordinates (1, 2 pi/n) and as e^(2pi*i/n), termed Omega_sub_n. This Omega enables both the direct FFT, which computes polynomial values at nth roots of unity (output: A evaluated at Omega^0 to Omega^(n-1)), and the inverse FFT, by utilizing Omega as Omega_sub_n^(n-1) to reconstruct coefficients from values.
