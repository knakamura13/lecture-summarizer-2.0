Conversion of a primal Linear Program (LP) to its Dual form begins with reformatting the primal into standard form. This standardization involves reversing inequalities, accomplished by multiplying them by negative one. For example, an inequality of -2x_1 + x_2 ≤ -3, when standardized, is expressed as -2x_1 + x_2 ≥ -3. The objective function of the Dual LP is derived from the right-hand side values of the primal's constraints, yielding a vector d of [1, -3] and formulating a minimization goal of Y_1 - 3Y_2. The constraint matrix E for the Dual LP is constructed as the transpose of the primal's constraint matrix, with rows corresponding to the primal LP's variable columns. Transposing the primal's variable columns [1, -2], [1, 1], and [-4, 0] generates Dual LP constraints of Y_1 - 2Y_2, Y_1 + Y_2, and -4Y_1, respectively. The right-hand side values for these constraints are obtained from the primal's objective function coefficients, forming a vector f of [5, -7, 2]. Consequently, the Dual LP's constraints are: Y_1 - 2Y_2 ≥ 5, Y_1 + Y_2 ≥ -7, and -4Y_1 ≥ 2.
