Lemma proved: G has a feasible flow iff G' has a saturating flow. To find a feasible flow in G, construct G', run max-flow, check if max-flow equals D for saturation. If saturated, convert the flow f' in G' to a feasible flow f in G. For maximum size feasible flow in G, start with feasible flow f, not zero flow as in Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp methods. In residual graph, augment f if possible. Continue until no s-t path in residual. Residual graph capacities: forward edges are capacity minus current flow, reverse edges are flow minus demand (if flow exceeds demand). To find max feasible flow, start with feasible f, adjust residual capacities for reverse edges to flow exceeding demand, not just flow.
