1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,635
 How do we find this Y?

2
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,150
 Or a better question is,

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,870
 what were the conditions that we needed on this Y?

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,460
 What do we need out of this Y?

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,745
 What we wanted that when we plug this Y in,

6
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,310
 that the left hand side was the objective function.

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,890
 Actually, we just need that it's at least the objective function.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,920
 If the left hand side would have been X1 plus 7X2 plus 10X3,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,370
 then, that still would have served as an upper bound on the objective function.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,603
 Is that would be only bigger,

11
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:30,630
 so any upper bound on

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,950
 that new function would serve as an upper bound also on the original objective function.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,560
 So let's ignore this specific Y.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,590
 What are the conditions,

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,515
 once again, that we need on this Y?

16
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:47,440
 What we need that this left hand side is at least the objective function.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,086
 So we need that the coefficient for X1 which is Y1 plus Y3,

18
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:56,534
 we need to be at least the coefficient of X1 in the objective function.

19
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:59,210
 So we need that Y1 plus Y3 is at least one.

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,902
 Similarly, for X2, we need that Y2 plus 3Y3 plus Y4 is at least six.

21
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:09,060
 And 2Y3 plus 3y4 is at least 10.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,138
 Now any Y satisfying these three constraints,

23
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,335
 when we plug it in,

24
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:17,795
 the left hand side will be at least the value of the objective function.

25
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:22,710
 So the right hand side will serve as an upper bound on the left hand side and therefore,

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,090
 is also an upper bound on the original objective function.

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,815
 So any Y satisfying these three constraints,

28
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:32,635
 gives us, yields an upper bound on the objective function.

29
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,695
 So we want to get the smallest possible upper bound.

30
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,323
 So we want to minimize the right hand side

31
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:41,430
 and this way we get the smallest possible upper bound.

32
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:49,695
 So our objective is to minimize 300y1 plus 200y2 plus 1000y3 plus 500y4.

33
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:51,450
 This is the right hand side here.

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,610
 And this is our dual LP.

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,650
 This is in fact a linear program.

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,975
 We're just trying to find the feasible Ys.

37
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:01,560
 Those Ys satisfying these three constraints and we want to

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,580
 find the feasible Y which minimizes this objective function.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,830
 So our original LP had a maximization.

40
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,400
 Now we have a minimization and our constraints originally were less than or

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,450
 equal to constraints and now they flipped to at least constraints.

42
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,220
 And notice that all these numbers,

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,935
 these coefficients are related to the original LP.

44
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:22,269
 Look, in our new objective function,

45
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:23,665
 where do we get 300,

46
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,060
 200, 1000 and 500 from?

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,990
 Well these are the right hand sides here.

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,920
 The right hand side there came from the right hand sides of the original constraints.

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,010
 So the right hand sides of

50
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,185
 the original constraints tell us the coefficients for our new LP.

51
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:43,515
 Where did the right hand side for these three constraints come from?

52
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:46,820
 Well these came from the coefficients in the objective function.

53
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,400
 So the coefficients in the original objective function define

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,330
 the right hand sides in this dual LP constraints.

55
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,840
 And the right hand side in the original LP constraints

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,280
 define the objective function in this dual LP.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,045
 So there's this sort of symmetry.

58
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:07,810
 Finally, where do the left hand side of the constraints come from?

59
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,320
 Well this first constrain,

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,555
 these are the terms which contain X1.

61
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:14,600
 Which constrains contain X1?

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,680
 Well the first constrain and the third constraint contain X1 and therefore,

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,215
 Y1 and Y3 appear in the first constraint.

64
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:26,490
 Which constrains contain X2?

65
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,165
 The second one, the third one and the fourth one.

66
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:33,330
 And therefore, in the second constraint, we have Y2,

67
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,350
 Y3 and Y4 appear because the second,

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,665
 third and fourth contain X2.

69
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,220
 One last note, notice,

70
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,005
 we have four constraints in the original LP.

71
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:46,830
 We're going to take a linear combination of these four constraints.

72
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,200
 We want to find out what are the coefficients in that linear combination.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,345
 So our variables, we're going to have four variables in our new LP,

74
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,375
 one corresponding to each of the constraints.

75
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,040
 So there are four constraints.

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,560
 Our new LP will have four variables and our original LP had three variables,

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,900
 and that's going to yield

78
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,380
 three constraints because we have to look at the coefficients for each

79
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,540
 of those variables and make sure they're

80
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,380
 at least the coefficients in the original objective function.

81
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,040
 So a number of variables in the original LP defines

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,240
 the number of constraints in the new LP, the dual LP.

83
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,985
 And the number of constraints in the original LP,

84
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:23,985
 defines the number of variables in the new dual LP.
