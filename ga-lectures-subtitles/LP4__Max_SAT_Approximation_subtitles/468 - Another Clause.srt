1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
 Take a look at another clause that has some positive and negative literals.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,020
 Consider this clause of size four: X1 bar,

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,470
 or X3, or X2, or X5 bar.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,220
 Now, we want, that if X1 is set to true,

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,660
 X3 is false, X2 is false,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,905
 and X5 is true which is going to correspond to Y1 being one,

7
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:25,035
 Y3 and Y2 being value zero and Y5 being value one.

8
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:27,813
 Then, we want that the variable Z, for this clause,

9
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,455
 let's say it's clause J,

10
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:34,665
 is forced to take value zero which corresponds to this clause being unsatisfied.

11
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:38,040
 Well, previously when we had just had positive form of these literals,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,735
 then we looked at the sum of the Y's appearing.

13
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:43,650
 Now, we're going to look at the complement for these negative literals.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,733
 So, we're going to look at one minus Y1

15
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,025
 plus Y3 plus Y2 because these appear in positive form.

16
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,765
 Plus one minus Y5,

17
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:53,785
 because it appears as a negative form,

18
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:57,180
 and we're going to constrain ZJ to be at most this quantity.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,995
 So, if this setting is true,

20
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,170
 then ZJ must be zero.

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,921
 For any other setting of these four Y's,

22
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,280
 then ZJ can be zero or one.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,570
 And in general, for clause CJ,

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,320
 we have to consider which literals are

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,460
 positive form and which literals are in negative form.

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,955
 So, let's use CJ plus and CJ superscript minus.

27
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:23,100
 CJ plus will of course be the positive literals in the Jth clause, in this case,

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,195
 it's X2 and X3 and CJ minus will be the negative literals,

29
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:27,195
 in this case X1 and X5.
