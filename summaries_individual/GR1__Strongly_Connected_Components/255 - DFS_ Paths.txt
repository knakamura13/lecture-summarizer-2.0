DFS algorithm used to identify connected components in an undirected graph can also find paths between any pair of vertices (v and w) in the same component. Track the predecessor vertex for each visited vertex, using a 'previous' array similar to Dijkstra's algorithm. Initialize the 'previous' array as null. Upon the first visit of a vertex, set its 'previous' to the vertex from which it was discovered. Post DFS, the 'previous' array enables backtracking to construct a path between any two connected vertices. Transitioning next to explore DFS applications in directed graphs.
