00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,955
 Divide and Conquer Algorithms or Recursive Algorithms

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,055
 is one of the first algorithmic tools that many of you may have learn.

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,790
 For example, binary search or merge sort.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,950
 To see the power of divide and conquer,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,960
 we'll look at a fundamental problem multiplying two n bit numbers.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,010
 Here, we'll assume the numbers are huge.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,460
 For example, they may be thousands of bits long.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,590
 This will be the case in an application such as RSA.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,790
 Since they are so large,

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,830
 we can no longer utilize the hardware implementation.

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,220
 We'll see a clever divide and conquer algorithm

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,440
 which is faster than the standard multiplication approach.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,760
 Another fundamental problem we'll look at is given n numbers,

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,825
 we'd like to find the median element.

15
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:39,162
 The numbers are unsorted,

16
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,860
 so they are in arbitrary order.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,830
 Can we find the median without first sorting the list?

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,820
 We'll look at a really ingenious divide and conquer algorithm to do just that.

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,230
 Finally, we'll dive into the beautiful FFT algorithm, Fast Fourier Transform.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,805
 It's impossible to overstate the importance of this algorithm,

21
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,035
 it's used in many fields.

22
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,280
 For example, signal processing.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,160
 In fact, it was called the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime.

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,340
 At least that was the case at time of the quote in 1994.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,060
 To understand FFT, we're going to have to recall some basics about complex numbers.

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,495
 Once you understand the basic mathematics behind it,

27
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:15,620
 you'll appreciate the beauty and simplicity of the algorithm.

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,065
 It will take some time and mental effort to get up to steam for the FFT algorithm,

29
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:19,065
 but it'll be worth it. It's a masterpiece.
