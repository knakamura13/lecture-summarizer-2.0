1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
 Now to recap, our weak duality theorem gave us two nice consequences.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,645
 The second consequence that we obtain was that if

3
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:11,790
 the primal LP was unbounded then the dual is infeasible.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,420
 This gave us a way of checking whether an LP is unbounded or not.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,185
 We simply first check whether the primal LP is infeasible or not.

6
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,925
 If it's not infeasible so the feasible region is

7
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:26,896
 non-empty then to check whether it's unbounded,

8
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:30,600
 we checked the dual LP and see whether it's infeasible or not.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,210
 Now, the original consequence was that if we find a feasible point for the primal LP and

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,880
 a feasible point for the dual LP and if

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,825
 the value of the objective function for these two points match up,

12
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:48,920
 we have equality then these two points that we obtained X and Y are optimal.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,630
 So, X achieves the optimal value for

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,390
 the primal LP object function and Y

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,380
 achieves the optimal value for the dual LP objective function.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,840
 Now for this specific example we consider,

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,520
 we were able to obtain a Y which achieved this equality.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,480
 Now, the question is, is there always a Y and an X which achieve equality here?

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 And that's the case if the primal LP and the dual LP are both bounded and feasible.
