In the analysis of a randomized algorithm, capital W represents the count of clauses satisfied by random variable assignments, with each being true or false (50% chance). Studying a single clause with a random variable Wj, which equals 1 if the clause (Cj) is satisfied and 0 if not, allows simplification. Summing Wj over all clauses equates to the total number satisfied, identical to capital W. To investigate the algorithm's expected performance, the focus shifts to the expected value of W, which can be broken down into the summation of expected Wj for each clause. This approach simplifies evaluation since the expected satisfaction of individual clauses (Wj) is independent of others, enabling analysis of each clause in isolation.
