00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
 The input to the vertex cover problem is undirected graph G,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,185
 and the goal which we'll call a budget, little b.

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:10,310
 Why do we change a terminology from goal to budget?

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,140
 Because instead of trying to find the maximum size clique or independent set,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,198
 we're trying to find the minimum size vertex cover.

6
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,285
 The output to the problem is a vertex cover,

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,905
 S, of size at most, little b.

8
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:25,260
 We're trying to find the smallest possible, if one exists.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,560
 And if no such vertex cover exists in the graph G,

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
 then we simply output NO.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,480
 We're going to prove now that the vertex cover problem is NP-complete.
