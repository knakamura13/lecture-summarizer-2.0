The algorithm's runtime is dominated by a set of nested for loops, iterating over a maximum of n elements each, paired with an Order(1) conditional statement, which collectively execute in Order(n^2) time. An additional non-nested for loop searches for a maximum value within the table and operates in Order(n) time. Consequently, the overall runtime complexity of the algorithm is determined to be Order(n^2).
