1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 So we're going to have two situations,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,250
 either s and t are connected by an edge and therefore,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,960
 we don't need to use any intermediate vertices,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,030
 or they're not connected by an edge and then there's

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,160
 no path from S to T. In the first case,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,230
 if there's a directed edge from S to T,

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,057
 then D of 0, S,

8
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:18,540
 T is exactly the length of that edge from S to

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,355
 T which is W of S T. In the other scenario,

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,449
 there's no edge from S to T. In this case,

11
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,435
 then what is the length of

12
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:31,975
 the shortest path from S to T which doesn't allow any intermediate vertices.

13
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:35,570
 It's infinite. Let's look at the shortest path from S to T

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,400
 where we only allow vertices one through I as intermediate vertices.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,920
 So this is the solution.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,750
 This path P is the solution to this problem.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,100
 And if there's multiple paths,

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,790
 just choose any path arbitrarily.

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,651
 So our goal is to figure out D of I, S,

20
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:56,311
 T. And we want to write recurrence for this so we want to do this for D of I,

21
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:59,440
 S, T in terms of smaller Is.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
 Okay? So we're going to have two cases.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,990
 We're considering this vertex as last vertex I.

24
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,395
 So what are the two cases for this path?

25
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:11,820
 Either this path uses vertex I or it doesn't use vertex I.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,265
 Let's try the two cases separately.

27
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,580
 So what's the easy case?

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,015
 The easy case is when the path doesn't include vertex

29
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:23,940
 I and then the slightly harder cases when the path includes vertex I.

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,270
 Let's start with the case where vertex I is not on

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,270
 the path and in this case what is D of I-
