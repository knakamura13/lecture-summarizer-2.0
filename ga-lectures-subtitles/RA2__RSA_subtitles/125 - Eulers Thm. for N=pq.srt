00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 What is Euler's Theorem tell us for the case when N equal P times Q,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,390
 where P and Q are prime numbers?

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,105
 For any Z which is relatively prime to N,

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,245
 which means that the GCD of Z and N is one,

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:17,280
 and if we take Z raised to the power phi of N, which is P minus one,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,390
 Q minus one, we get back one_mod_N, which is P_times_Q.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,220
 This fact here, is going to be the basis for the RSA algorithm.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,865
 We're going to generate a pair of prime numbers, P and Q.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,805
 And we're going to look at P_times_Q,

10
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:35,195
 and we're going to have a message,

11
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:38,305
 and we're going to use this P_minus_one, Q_minus_one,

12
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:42,151
 to generate a encryption key and the decryption key,

13
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,080
 and this is going to give us a basic fact,

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,885
 which is going to allow the encryption and decryption.

15
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,210
 Let's investigate this a little bit more and then will

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,210
 see the basic idea of the RSA algorithm.
