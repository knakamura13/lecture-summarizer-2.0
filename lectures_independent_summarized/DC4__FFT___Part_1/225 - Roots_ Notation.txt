The nth roots of unity are located at equidistant points on the unit circle in polar coordinates as (1, 2πj/n) for j=0 to n-1, increments in angles of θ=2π/n. Omega (ωn) denotes the point at j=1; subsequent points are powers of ωn. ωn to the power of n equals 1. Nth roots are ωn^0 to ωn^(n-1). They can be expressed using Euler's formula as ωn = e^(2πi/n); thus, ωn^j for j=0 to n-1 equals e^(2πij/n).
