00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 The strong duality theorem states that,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,550
 the primal LP is feasible and bounded.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,750
 So it is not infeasible and it is not unbounded.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,795
 So the feasible region is non-empty,

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,930
 and there is an optimal solution.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,204
 If this is the case for the primal LP,

7
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:17,645
 then the dual LP has a similar scenario.

8
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:21,300
 It's also feasible and bounded and vice versa.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,015
 Now, if the primal LP is feasible and bounded,

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,420
 that means there exists an optimal solution.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,290
 So an equivalent formulation of this statement is the following.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,490
 The primal has an optimal point X star,

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,205
 if and only if the dual LP has an optimal point Y star.

14
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,195
 So if there is an optimal point for one,

15
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:41,460
 then there's an optimal point for the other.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,305
 Now, what do we know about these optimal points?

17
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:47,490
 When we saw in our earlier example that these objective functions match up.

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,830
 And that turns out to always be the case.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,100
 The value of this object function at X star,

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,045
 equals the value of this objective function at Y star.

21
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:01,430
 So C transpose X star equals B transpose Y star.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,600
 So for every LP given the optimal solution X star,

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,714
 there is always a certificate from the dual LP

24
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:14,875
 which certifies that that is in fact an optimal solution.

25
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,650
 Now, one of the nice implications of

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,795
 this strong duality theorem is that if we write the LP for the max flow problem,

27
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:25,320
 then the value of the objective function for that LP is

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,770
 the size of the max flow from S to T. Now,

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:36,035
 if we write the dual LP it turns out that what we get is the capacity of the min st-cut.

30
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,505
 Now, since these are dual LPs of each other,

31
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:40,855
 then we know that we have equality.

32
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:45,720
 So the size of the maximum flow equals the capacity of the min st-cut.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,287
 So this max flow min theorem which we saw earlier in the max flow section,

34
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:50,287
 we can also prove it using strong duality theorem.
