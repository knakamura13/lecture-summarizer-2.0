1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,365
 Let's try to get some idea for the reduction.

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:05,430
 So let's take a sample input for the SAT problem.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,180
 So here's a formula with four variables and three clauses.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,895
 Let's label the clauses as C1, C2, and C3.

5
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:15,390
 Now, let's define our input for the three set problem,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,655
 let's denote this as f prime,

7
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:20,725
 where clause 1 and clause 3 we can keep the same.

8
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:22,230
 Those are valid inputs.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,420
 Those are valid clauses for a three set.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,970
 Now, the challenge is what do we do with the second clause.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,720
 This is a clause of size four,

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,475
 but valid inputs with three set has size at most three.

13
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:35,475
 So what are we going to do for this second clause.

14
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:38,705
 Well, we're going to create a new variable y and we're going to

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,295
 replace the second clause by the following pair of clauses.

16
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:46,005
 So it's x2 bar or x3 or y.

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,170
 These are the first two literals in C2 and

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,700
 the second clause is y bar or x1 bar or x4 bar.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,725
 These are the last two literals in the clause C2.

20
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:00,900
 Now, the key claim is that this original clause C2 of size four is

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,580
 satisfiable if and only if this new pair of clauses is satisfiable.

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,250
 So C2 is satisfiable if and only if C2 prime is satisfiable.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,250
 Therefore, replacing C2 by this pair of clauses makes an equivalent formula.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,690
 And in this new formula,

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:18,690
 all the clauses have size-
