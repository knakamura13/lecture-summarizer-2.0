This particular input has a satisfying assignment. I can set x1 to true, x2 to false, x3 to false. Let's check it. So for the first clause, I have that x2 is false, so this is our satisfied variable. For the second clause, I have that x2 is true, so this is a satisfied literal. For the third clause, I have that x3 is false, so this is a satisfied literal. For the last clause, I have that x3 is false, so this is a satisfied literal. So every clause has at least one literal satisfied.
