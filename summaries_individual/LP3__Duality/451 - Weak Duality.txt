Weak duality theorem established: feasible primal LP at point X results in objective function value of C^T X, aimed to be maximized; feasible dual LP at point Y yields B^T Y as the objective function value, serving as an upper bound for primal's objective function. Consequently, C^T X (primal's objective) is always less than or equal to B^T Y (dual's objective). This relationship confirms that any feasible solution for dual LP caps the maximum potential value of the primal LP's objective function.
