Cover graph algos: DFS (depth-1st search), BFS (breadth-1st search), Dijkstra's (single src shortest path). Review DFS for connected comps in undir. graphs, extend to dir. graphs for strongly connected comps. Strongly connected comps = connected comps analog in dir. graphs, apply this for the two set prob. Examine MST (minimum spanning tree) prob using Kruskal's and Prim's algo, assess their correctness. Finally, delve into PageRank algo used by Google to rank webpages, based on Brin/Page invention. Introduce Markov chains for PageRank context, link to strongly connected comps.
