S and S' are sets with elements related to a prime number P. S consists of numbers 1 to P-1. S' has elements of the form kZ mod P for k=1 to P-1. To prove S and S' are identical, it is shown that S' elements are distinct and non-zero. For distinctness, assuming two elements are equal leads to a contradiction using the fact that every number 1 to P-1 has an inverse modulo P. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by the inverse of Z shows that equal elements must have the same index, contradicting the presumption of distinct indices, proving all elements in S' are distinct. For non-zero proof, if any S' element is zero, multiplying by Z's inverse suggests index I would be zero modulo P, outside the range of 1 to P-1, another contradiction. Thus, S' elements are non-zero and occupy all values 1 to P-1, implying S equals S' with order as the only differing factor.
