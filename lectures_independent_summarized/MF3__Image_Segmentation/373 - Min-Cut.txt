Goal: transform a maximization problem into a min st-cut problem by modifying weights. Challenge: currently, the problem involves both summation and subtraction of non-negative terms. Solution: necessary to convert the subtraction of separation penalties into addition to ensure all terms are positive/non-negative, aligning with min st-cut problem where all capacities are positive.
