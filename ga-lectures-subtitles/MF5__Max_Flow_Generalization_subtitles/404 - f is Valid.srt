1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 Now in order to show that this flow F is valid,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,995
 we need to show that for every vertex,

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:08,485
 the flow in equals the flow out of the vertex.

4
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:11,110
 Now this is for every internal vertex.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,320
 So this is for every vertex in the original graph except for S

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,905
 and T. Now this is for the flow F that we constructed.

7
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:19,580
 Now what do we know?

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,330
 We know that this flow F prime was an output from the max flow problem.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,500
 So F prime is a valid flow for the graph G prime.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,480
 So we know in this graph G prime,

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,200
 the flow into the vertex V equals the flow out from

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,205
 the vertex V. So we want to use this fact to imply this fact.

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,905
 So let's take a look at this first quantity.

14
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:44,180
 The flow into the vertex V in this graph G prime.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,520
 Now which vertices have edges to the vertex V?

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,345
 This is in the graph G prime that we constructed.

17
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:54,000
 While this new vertex S prime has an edge to every vertex.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,770
 So there's an edge from S prime to V and for every vertex in the original graph,

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,590
 if U was connected to V in the original graph,

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,560
 then it's still connected in this new graph G prime.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,390
 Now what do we know about this first term?

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,990
 We assume that F prime was a saturating flow.

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,605
 That means that all the edges out of S prime are fully capacitated.

24
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:18,140
 So this flow along this edge is up to its full capacity.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,180
 What's the capacity of this edge?

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,630
 It was defined to be the demand into the vertex V. Now what about this latter quantity?

27
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,070
 Well let's rewrite this flow F prime along this edge in terms of

28
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,860
 F. The flow F along this edge from U to V was,

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,500
 by our definition, equal to the flow of F prime along this edge plus the demand.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,270
 Therefore, F prime equals F along this edge minus the demand along this edge.

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,278
 That we can factor out this sum over U to each of these terms

32
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:56,335
 and then this latter quantity is minus the sum over U

33
00:01:56,335 --> 00:02:01,660
 of the demand into V. So that sum is equal to the demand into

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,490
 V. So this term and this term cancel each other out and what are we left with?

35
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:15,050
 We're left with the flow into V in this flow F. So that means the flow into V under

36
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,770
 this flow F prime is equal to the flow into V in

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,410
 this flow F. Now that's not too surprising because we set up this flow,

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,640
 this capacity along this edge from S prime to offset this difference.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,685
 So this was by design but we have this nice fact,

40
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:37,490
 the flow into V is the same in F prime and in F and similarly you can show

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:44,615
 that the flow out of V under F prime and F are the same by similar algebra.

42
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:50,000
 So therefore, if the flow into V is the same as the flow out of V under

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,895
 F prime and F prime and F have the same flow into V and the same flow out of V,

44
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:59,705
 then we also have this statement that we want to prove.

45
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,245
 So we've shown that F is a valid flow.

46
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:07,325
 So we've shown that we can take a saturating flow F prime and we can construct

47
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:11,290
 a feasible flow F by simply setting F

48
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,530
 equal to the flow F prime plus the demand along the edge.

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:15,530
 Now we have to prove the reverse direction.
