Now a cut of the graph is a partition of the vertices and two sets. We will think of these two sets as the left side and the right side. So we denote it as L and R. Then we are going to be looking at st-cuts. These are a particular type of cuts. This is the cut which separates S from T. So S is on one side, let's say the left side, and T is in the right side. Now here's our example of a flow network that we looked at earlier. Let's mark an example of an st-cut in this graph. Here's an example of an st-cut. We put these four vertices S, A, B and F in the set L. Notice this set doesn't have to be a connected set. F is not connected to A and B in this subset. And the set R are the remaining four vertices, C, D, E and T. Now we're going to be interested in the capacity of this st-cut. What exactly is the capacity? Recall is a directed graph. We're going to look at these directed edges VW where V is in the left side and W was in the right side. So these are all edges which go from the set L to the set R and we're going to look at the capacity of these edges. So we're looking at the total capacity of edges from the set L to R. But we're not looking at edges from R to L. So we're looking at sum of the capacities of these six edges which exit L. Notice that these edges such as C to F which go into L do not count in this count.
