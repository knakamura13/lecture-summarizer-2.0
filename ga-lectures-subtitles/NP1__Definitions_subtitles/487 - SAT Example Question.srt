1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,295
 Let's make sure you recall the notation for the SAT problem.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,785
 So once you go ahead and write a satisfying assignment for this formula,

3
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:09,640
 so give an assignment for X1,

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,475
 X2 and X3, so that the formula evaluates to TRUE.

5
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:13,475
 If there's no such satisfying assignment then go ahead and enter no.
