Stationary distribution π, satisfying πP = π, is invariant under transition matrix P and represents web page probabilities in a random walk. For a million web pages, π is a 1-million vector, P is a million-squared matrix. Entry πX is obtained by dot product of π's row and P's 900th column, summing only over Y with edge to X, reflecting web graph connectivity. In a simple random walk, a web page's rank (stationary distribution) mirrors citation intuition where important pages are more likely to be visited, providing a natural importance measure. Essential components in π are determined by neighboring edges and citation counts, leading to equivalent random walk and citation-based page rank definitions.
