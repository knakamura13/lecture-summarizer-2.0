1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,135
 Our goal is to choose a subset S which is a representative of the set A.

2
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:08,185
 What exactly do we mean by representative of the set A?

3
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:11,190
 We want that the median of this subset S

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,315
 is also a reasonable approximation to the median of the set A.

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,460
 Now the median of A has

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,555
 half the elements smaller than it and half the elements bigger than it.

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,950
 Now in order for the media of S to approximate this median,

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,315
 what we want is that each element of S is somehow has a similar flavor.

9
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:34,770
 So we want that each element of S has the following property.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,405
 We want that there a few elements of A that we can guarantee are at most X

11
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:45,210
 and a few elements of A are at least X so that these elements of A,

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,110
 which are represented by this element X.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,060
 What exactly do we mean by few?

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,040
 Well, let's say it's two.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,450
 We have at least two elements of A,

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,450
 which are at most X and at least two elements,

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,850
 which are at least X and then if we combine,

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,275
 add in X itself,

19
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:04,130
 then we've got five elements here that we're considering.

20
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,870
 We want to look at sets of five elements and we

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,100
 want X to represent that set of five elements.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,895
 So what we're going to do is we're going to break A

23
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,610
 into N over five groups of five elements each.

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,675
 Let's assume N is a power of five,

25
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,490
 so that this can be done cleanly.

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,960
 Now how are we going to get this subset S from this partition of A?

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,500
 Well, we're going to choose one representative from each group.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,180
 Each group is going to choose or we're going to

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,570
 choose one representative one element of this group,

30
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,065
 which is going to represent the group in the following sense.

31
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,770
 It's going to represent the group in the sense that at least two of

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,072
 the elements of this group are at most the chosen element,

33
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:49,050
 and at least two of the elements are at least the chosen element.

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,845
 Let's take a look at a particular group to see how we do this.

35
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,990
 Let's look at a group G consisting of the elements X1,

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,175
 X2, X3, X4, X5.

37
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,550
 Now who do we want to choose from this group to represent

38
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,790
 this group in the sense that we talked about just before?

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,580
 Let's look at this group sorted.

40
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,100
 Let's sort the group and relabel it so that X1 is the most,

41
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,430
 X2 is a most, X3 and so on.

42
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,040
 Now who are we're going to choose to represent it in this sense?

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,715
 Well, we're going to choose the middle element.

44
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,200
 The median of this group.

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,930
 X3 has the desired property.

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,490
 At least three elements of G are at most X3,

47
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,355
 including X3 itself, and at least three elements including X3 again are at least X3.

48
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:33,315
 If we take the median of each of these groups,

49
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:40,135
 then that gives N over five elements and each of those chosen elements in the subset S,

50
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:44,310
 it represents a distinct group of five elements so that each have

51
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,850
 this desired property and this subset S is going to be

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,885
 a good representative sample of this entire array A.

53
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:55,790
 And that's it. Now we have the whole idea for finding a good pivot.

54
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,327
 We take this array A,

55
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,640
 we break it into N over five groups of five elements each. F.

56
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,895
 Or each group, what we do is we sort it.

57
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,890
 How long does it take us to sort?

58
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,685
 Well, notice this group is of five elements.

59
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,985
 So sorting it takes order one time.

60
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,895
 It doesn't matter what algorithm we use.

61
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,445
 If we take an exponential time algorithm,

62
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,410
 exponential N five is still order one.

63
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,310
 So it takes us order one time to sort this group and then we

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,190
 can take the median element of this group and that's going to be

65
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,310
 the representative sample for this group and we take

66
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,425
 the one median to one representative sample from each group.

67
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:33,630
 That gives us N over five samples and that

68
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,083
 gives us our subset S and then we take the median that subset S,

69
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:43,040
 recursively we find it and that gives us the pivot that we use for A.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,660
 And then we're going to prove that that pivot that we find,

71
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,495
 which is the median of this subset S, is a good pivot.

72
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,620
 Let's go ahead and detail the pseudo code for this algorithm and then we'll go

73
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,790
 back and look at the claims that we're making about this pivot,

74
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,167
 being a good pivot,

75
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:57,167
 and look at the running time of our algorithm.
