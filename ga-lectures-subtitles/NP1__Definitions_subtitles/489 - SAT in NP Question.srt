1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
 Now, we just saw a particular input formula f and we saw satisfying assignment for it.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,820
 And then we checked that that satisfying assignment was

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,090
 in fact satisfied this formula f. So,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,330
 when we plugged in that assignment of true and false to the variables,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,270
 that the formula f evaluated to true.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,950
 Now, let's look at the general problem.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,785
 Suppose I give you a formula f and I give you

8
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:26,100
 assignment of true or false to each of the variables.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,140
 Now, what is the running time to verify that

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,460
 this assignment actually evaluates this formula to true?

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,055
 So, this assignment satisfies the formula.

12
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:39,005
 As a function of n and m, what is the running time to do that?

13
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:39,005
 Why don't you go ahead and write the running time in big O notation.
