Early LP example with variables X_1, X_2, X_3, and four constraints, including non-negativity. Simplex algorithm used, optimal value found at vertex (200, 200, 100) with objective function profit at 2400. Verification of optimality needed. Approach: upper bound the profit to confirm maximum profit cannot exceed 2400. Method involves using linear combinations of satisfied constraints to establish objective function upper bound.
