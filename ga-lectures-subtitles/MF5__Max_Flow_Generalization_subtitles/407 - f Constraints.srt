1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
 So we need to check that the flow into every vertex,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,550
 except for S prime and T prime,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,760
 under F prime, equals the flow out.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,150
 Now we started from F,

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,575
 and we know that the flow into the vertex V, under F,

6
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,165
 equals the flow out from the vertex V.

7
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:19,075
 So now we're going to do a little bit of algebra that's similar to before.

8
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:22,770
 So we want to go from this fact, to this fact.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,087
 Now, what is the flow into the vertex V under F prime?

10
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:29,195
 Where we have the flow from S prime,

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:35,420
 we set that equal to the demand into the vertex V. So this is the flow from S prime.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,615
 Now for every other edge,

13
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:41,565
 the flow from that vertex U to V in F prime,

14
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:46,860
 is it defined to be the flow in F minus the demand along this edge?

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:54,090
 As before, this sum over U of this demand into V is the same as this quantity.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,145
 They're both equal to the total demand into V. So they offset each other,

17
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:03,360
 and we're left with the total flow into V under F. So as before,

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,400
 the flow into V under F,

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,730
 is the same as the flow into V under F prime.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,340
 And similarly, the flow out of V under F prime,

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,900
 equals the flow out of V under F, by similar calculation.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,020
 Therefore, since the flow into V equals the flow out of V under F,

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,200
 and these are equal to F prime,

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,630
 we also have this factor F prime.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,630
 And therefore, F prime is a va.
