 The input to the subset sum problem are n

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,796
 positive integers which we'll denote as A_1 through A_n,

3
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:07,685
 and one additional integer,

4
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:11,250
 t. Our goal is to find a subset of numbers which sum

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,060
 up to exactly t. So we want the sum over the indices in

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,590
 this subset of the corresponding numbers to be equal to exactly

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,900
 t. We output such a subset if it exists and otherwise, we output NO.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,795
 This is a great practice problem for dynamic programming.

9
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:32,685
 Using dynamic programming, we can solve this problem in order n times t time.

10
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:32,685
 If you want practice with dynamic programming, I suggest you
