1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,505
 Now we'll dive into randomized algorithms.

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:03,750
 Hopefully at the end,

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,765
 you'll appreciate how randomness is a beautiful and powerful algorithmic tool.

4
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:09,330
 We'll start with cryptography.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,850
 We'll look at the amazing RSA Cryptosystem.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,480
 This is one of the most widely used Cryptosystems.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,960
 It's extremely elegant.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,545
 Once we learn some of the basic mathematics about modular arithmetic,

9
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,550
 you'll appreciate the ingenuity of the RSA protocol.

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,430
 Then you'll have a basic understanding of how these Cryptosystem that we use everyday,

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,070
 many times a day in fact, actually work.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,740
 Another beautiful and incredibly useful application of

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,005
 randomized algorithms that we'll study is for hashing.

14
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:38,130
 We're going to look at a hashing scheme known as Bloom Filters.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,845
 This is a simple scheme that's quite popular in many different fields.

16
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,825
 We'll look at the mathematics behind it.

17
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:47,010
 This will involve some basic probability analysis and then you'll

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,010
 do a programming project to implement and study Bloom Filters.
