Once again, the general computational problem that we're considering is, given this vector of coefficients for A of X, and this vector of coefficients defining B of X, we want to compute their convolution C. Now a simple algorithm for computing this convolution is going to compute each of these coefficients in turn. Now there were order n coefficient. How long did it take to compute each coefficient? Well a naive algorithm takes order K time to compute the Kth coefficient because there are order K terms that we have to sum up. This is going to lead to an order n squared time algorithm to compute all of the order n coefficients of the polynomial C of X. What we are going to do now in this lecture is an order n log n time algorithm for computing this product polynomial C of X, the convolution of a_n.
