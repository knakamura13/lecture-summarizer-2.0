Modular exponentiation—a critical computing task for large n-bit numbers X, Y, N—is key, especially when n (~1000 or 2000) means X, Y, and N can be as large as 2^(1000 or 2000). Aim for an efficient algorithm, polynomial to the number of bits n, not the numbers' magnitude, which is exponentially greater, rendering an exponential time algorithm infeasible. Traditional multiplication of n-bit numbers takes O(n^2) time, making the naive method (multiplying sequentially and taking modulo N each step) exponentially slow at O(n^2 * 2^n), an impractical approach for large n. To improve, leverage repeated squaring for efficiency, relying on powers of two for a better time complexity.
