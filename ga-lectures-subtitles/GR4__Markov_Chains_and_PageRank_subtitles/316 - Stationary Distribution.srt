00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,615
 Let's recap what we know so far about stationary distributions of a Markov Chain.

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:08,485
 So let's consider a Markov Chain defined by the transition matrix P,

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:12,240
 now if our Markov Chain is defined on end states then

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,010
 we consider any distribution pi on those end states,

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,840
 so this is a row vector of size N,

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,710
 so for any pi which satisfies pi times P equals pi,

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,660
 so pi once again is a eigenvector with eigenvalue

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,550
 1 for P then such a pi is a stationary distribution.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,110
 What this equation says is that,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,070
 if we start in distribution pi and we do one step of our random walk

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,890
 defined by P then we'll stay in the stationary distribution pi,

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,105
 so pi' isn't variant.

13
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:46,230
 Once we reach it we stay in it.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,660
 Now this defines a stationary distribution.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,730
 Now, when is there such a pi?

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,715
 What Markov Chains have a stationary distribution?

17
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:57,055
 And if there is one, is it unique or there's multiple ones?

18
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:01,200
 Under what properties do we have multiple or unique stationary distributions?

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,690
 And for our simple 62-10 example,

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,895
 we noticed that no matter where you started,

21
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:09,030
 you always reached the stationary distribution.

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,955
 So in this case when there's a unique stationary distribution,

23
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,340
 regardless of where we start,

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,045
 do we always reach this stationary distribution?

25
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,860
 Finally, in this case where there is

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,755
 a unique stationary distribution and we always reach it,

27
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,603
 we could ask how fast we reach it.

28
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:25,270
 This is known as the mixing time of the Markov Chain.

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,490
 How fast the Markov Chain reaches its stationary distribution.

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,560
 This is one of the things I study in my research,

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,125
 trying to prove bounds about the mixing time of Markov Chains.

32
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,625
 We're not going to look at the mixing time here but what we are going to look at,

33
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,670
 our properties of the Markov Chain which ensure that we have

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,905
 a unique stationary distribution and that we always reach the stationary distribution.

35
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,750
 So regardless of where we started from,

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,605
 we eventually in the limit over time will reach a stationary distribution.

37
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:56,940
 In order to see which properties ensure a unique stationary distribution,

38
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,330
 let's look at examples where we have multiple stationary distributions.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,730
 That will give us some insight into the properties

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:02,730
 needed to guarantee a unique stationary distribution.
