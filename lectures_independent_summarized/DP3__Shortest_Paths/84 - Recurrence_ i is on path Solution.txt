To create the recurrence for D(i, s, t), we modify the parameter i to i-1 to utilize a previously solved subproblem in a dynamic programming approach. For a path from s to i using the first i-1 vertices as intermediate points, we use D(i-1, s, i), while for i to t, we have D(i-1, i, t) with the same vertex set as intermediates. The total path length combines these subproblems. The recurrence formula for D(i, s, t) is thus the sum of D(i-1, s, i) and D(i-1, i, t). We then determine the optimal solution by comparing scenarios where vertex i is included or excluded from the path.
