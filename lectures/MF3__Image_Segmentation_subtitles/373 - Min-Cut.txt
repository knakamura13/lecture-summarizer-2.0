Now our goal is to reduce this problem, this maximisation problem, to the min st-cut problem. So we have to somehow change this maximisation problem into a minimization problem. So we are going to have to modify these weights. And the other issue is that we are summing some terms and we are subtracting other terms. Now all of these parameters are non-negative. In our min st-cut problem, all the capacities in the input flow network are all positive. So we somehow need to change this minus of the separation penalty into an addition, so that all the terms are positive or non-negative.
