Constructed subset sum instance solution proves 3SAT problem satisfiability, confirming value reduction. Solution S sums to target T. N initial digits match N 3SAT variables X1-Xn. One must choose Vi or Vi' (representing true or false) for each i to achieve T's required one per digit, as choosing both sums to two, none to zero. This subset sum solution translates to a true/false variable assignment, which must be further examined to confirm it satisfies the original 3SAT problem.
