Maximizing function x1 + 6x2 to find the optimal point within a feasible region defined by constraints. The linear relationship x1 + 6x2 = C represents various profit lines. The goal is to maximize C, where the line intersects the feasible region. Through evaluation, the line x1 + 6x2 = 600 is suboptimal, as a higher C value is achievable. The optimal solution is found where the line x1 + 6x2 = 1300 intersects the feasible region's vertex, yielding the maximum profit at point (100, 200), with C, or profit, being 1300. This concept applicable in 2D extends to 3D and higher dimensions.
