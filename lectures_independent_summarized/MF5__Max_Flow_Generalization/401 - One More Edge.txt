In constructing graph G prime, an additional edge from T to S is introduced to adjust for S and T being internal vertices with differing constraints on flow compared to the original graph. Despite no flow capacity into S and out of T in the current setup, this edge, with infinite capacity, ensures the flow out of S equals the flow into T, balancing the system and completing the construction of G prime.
