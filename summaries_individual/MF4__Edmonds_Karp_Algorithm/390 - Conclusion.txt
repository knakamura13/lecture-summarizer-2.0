Adding edge y to z in a residual network implies reverse edge z to y is on the augment path. Removing edge y to z indicates edge y to z is on the augment path. Edge removal equals capacity elimination, necessitating increased flow via this edge; it must be on augment path for flow increase. Adding an edge equals spare capacity rise; flow reduction on the edge requires augmentation of the reverse direction edge, placing it on the augment path.
