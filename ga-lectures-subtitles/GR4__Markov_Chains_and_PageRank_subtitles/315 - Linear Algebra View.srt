1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 Now here's a running example once again.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,150
 Now let's suppose that at time zero I'm in state

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,755
 two and I want to know the state at time t equals one.

4
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:12,060
 What's the distribution for the state at time t equals one?

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,535
 Well, how do I get it? Why just look at this row.

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,640
 The second row of this transition matrix tells

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,910
 me the distribution for the state at time t equals 1.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,455
 It's the one step transition matrix.

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:25,505
 Now what's another way to get row two.

10
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:30,300
 Well, I can take this vector which has a one in entry

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,313
 two and zeros everywhere else and I can multiply this row vector by this matrix,

12
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:36,560
 and then what do I get?

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,995
 I get row two of this matrix.

14
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:42,540
 So this my distribution at times zero and I multiply that by

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,810
 the transition matrix and I get the distribution at time t equals one.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,620
 And in general at time zero I don't have to be in a fixed state.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,290
 I can be in a distribution over the states.

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,535
 So let M be an arbitrary distribution over the end states.

19
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,015
 So what exactly does that mean.

20
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,570
 That means M is this vector and this row vector of

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,480
 size N and it's a probability distribution,

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
 so the sum of these entries is exactly

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,355
 one and all these entries are between zero and one.

24
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,760
 Now we're placing this factor by distribution,

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,345
 M. Then here we have P and then we get a distribution at time t equals one.

26
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:21,700
 So let's call this M zero to denote the distribution at times zero.

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,740
 And over here, we get a distribution for the time t equals one,

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,275
 so let's call this M one.

29
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:29,760
 In general, if you take M zero so

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,570
 the distribution at time zero and multiply by this matrix P,

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,110
 the transition matrix, then we get the distribution for the state at time t equals one.

32
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,920
 So we take this row vector for the distribution of time zero,

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,110
 multiply by one step.

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,470
 So we do one step of our random walk and then we get the distribution,

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,950
 the row vector for the state at time t equals one.

36
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,620
 Now the key property is that for

37
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,795
 a stationary distribution pi for any stationary distribution pi.

38
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:01,860
 So if I am in the stationary distribution at time zero or at

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,985
 any time t and I look at the state at time t plus one,

40
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,035
 then what is the distribution going to be?

41
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:11,510
 Well once I reach this distribution, I stay in it.

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,805
 It's the limiting distribution.

43
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:15,240
 It's like a fixed point of the process.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,950
 So once you reach a fixed point you stay in

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,880
 a fixed point and that's the same for a stationary distribution.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,655
 So if I'm in the stationary distribution at time t,

47
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:28,175
 and I do one step then I'm still in the stationary distribution pi.

48
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,665
 So pi times P equals pi.

49
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,695
 What does that mean in terms of linear algebra?

50
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,235
 Well this pi is an eigenvector with eigenvalue one.

51
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:43,740
 So pi is an eigenvector for this matrix P and it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue one.

52
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,520
 One turns out to be the largest eigenvalue for this matrix.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,850
 So this is the principle eigenvector for this matrix.

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,915
 Now there can be multiple eigenvectors with eigenvalue one.

55
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,320
 We're going to look at situations where we know that there

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,835
 is at most one eigenvector with eigenvalue one.

57
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:01,835
 So there is at most one stationary distribution.
