To demonstrate that the off-diagonal entries of a product matrix equal zero, we consider two distinct indices k and j. When k ≠ j, the entry at position k, j is shown to be zero by evaluating the dot product between the kth row of one matrix and the jth column of another. This dot product is a sum of terms involving powers of omega_n^(j-k), where omega_n is an nth root of unity. By changing variables to omega representing omega_n^(j-k), the sum simplifies to 1 + omega + omega^2 + ... + omega^(n-1). Since omega is an nth root of unity but not equal to 1, the sum of these powers equals zero. This conclusion relies on the underlying property of nth roots of unity, which stipulates that the sum of its consecutive powers—when the base is not equal to 1—will always result in zero. This property confirms the zero value of off-diagonal entries and completes the proof of the lemma.
