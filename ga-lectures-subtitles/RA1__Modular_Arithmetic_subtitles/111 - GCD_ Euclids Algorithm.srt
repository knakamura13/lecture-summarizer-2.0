00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
 What we just saw is the following fact known as Euclid's Rule.

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:08,985
 The gcd of x and y is the same as the gcd of x_mod_y and y.

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,530
 This leads to a natural,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,880
 recursive algorithm which we'll now detail.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,305
 Here's Euclid's GCD algorithm.

6
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:18,650
 The input to the algorithm are two integers, x and y.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,690
 And we'll assume these input parameters are ordered so that x is

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,665
 at least y and that both of these integers are non-negative.

9
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:29,435
 And the output of the algorithm is the gcd of x and y.

10
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:30,750
 This is the recursive algorithm,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,205
 so let's start with the base case.

12
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,055
 The base case will be when y,

13
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:36,870
 the smaller parameter, is equal to zero.

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,435
 When y equals zero,

15
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:40,635
 so we're looking at the gcd of x and zero,

16
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:43,620
 we're going to return x as the gcd.

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,670
 Now, to be honest,

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,200
 this case actually is confusing to me.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,420
 So, we'll go back and we'll discuss this more in a little bit more detail after.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,210
 Now, in the general case, we're just going to apply Euclid's rule.

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,180
 Euclid's rule tells us that the gcd of x and y is the same as the gcd of x_mod_y and y.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,360
 So, we're going to return the recursive call of Euclid's algorithm on y and x_mod_y.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,450
 We flip the order of these two parameters in order to

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,515
 maintain the fact that the first parameter is at least the second parameter.

25
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,320
 That completes the pseudocode of the algorithm.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,320
 Let's go back and look at the space case a little.
