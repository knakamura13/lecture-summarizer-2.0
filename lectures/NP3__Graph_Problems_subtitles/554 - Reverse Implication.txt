Now, let's prove the reverse implication. Let's take an independent set, S-bar, and let's prove that S is a vertex cover. S-bar, we're assuming, is an independent set. So what do we know? We know that no edge is fully contained in this set, S-bar. Therefore, we know that, at most, one of the endpoints, x or y, is in the set, S-bar. If both endpoints, x and y, are in S-bar, then that means the edge is fully contained in the set, S-bar, and therefore, S-bar is not an independent set. But since it's an independent set, at most, one of the endpoints or neither the endpoints is in the set, S-bar. If at most, one is in S-bar, then at least one is in S. Thus, S covers every edge of the graph, because for every edge of the graph, at least one of the endpoints is in S. And therefore, S is a vertex cover. This proves this direction, that if S-bar is an independent set, then S is a vertex cover. And that completes the proof of the claim. Now, we can do the reduction.
