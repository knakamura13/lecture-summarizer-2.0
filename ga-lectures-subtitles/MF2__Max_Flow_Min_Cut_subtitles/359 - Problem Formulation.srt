1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
 Let's formally state the min st-cut problem.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,670
 The input is a flow network.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,365
 So we have a directed graph with a specified start and end vertex.

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:12,450
 And for every edge, we have a positive capacity.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,755
 Now the output for the min st-cut problem,

6
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:18,160
 it's an st-cut (L, R),

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,780
 so s has to be an L and t has to be an

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,130
 R. And we want to find that st-cut with minimum capacity.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,980
 Recall the capacity of this cut is

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,565
 the sum of the capacities of the edges that go from L to R,

11
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,125
 and we ignore the edges that go from R to

12
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,760
 L. Now let's take a look at this cut that we looked at earlier.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,710
 So the set L contains s,

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,230
 a, b and f. Now,

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,455
 the capacity of this cut is A plus two,

16
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,945
 plus two, plus five,

17
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:51,270
 plus seven, plus three.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,480
 So the capacity is 27.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,155
 We want to find the cut of minimum capacity.

20
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,665
 Here is an st-cut of minimum capacity.

21
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:03,090
 R simply contains T and L contains everybody else.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,575
 The capacity of this cut is 12.

23
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:11,260
 We just have these two edges exiting L to R. How do we know this is min st-cut?

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,760
 Well, we're going to prove the Max-flow-min-cut theorem which says that

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,290
 the size of the Max flow equals the size of the min st-cut.

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,060
 We know there's a flow in this graph of size

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,410
 12 and since there is an st-cut of capacity 12,

28
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:25,410
 therefore we know that this flow and this st-cut are both optimal.
