Pivot p is good if it ranks between n/4 and 3n/4 in a list, guaranteeing at most 3n/4 elements are either smaller or larger than p. Need to find such a pivot in linear time (O(n)) to enable a recurrence where the subproblemâ€™s size is at most 3n/4, also solved in linear time, leading to an overall linear time solution. Main challenge: devise a method to identify a good pivot within O(n) time.
