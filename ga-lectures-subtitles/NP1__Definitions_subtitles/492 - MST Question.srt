1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,265
 So recall the MST problem.

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:06,987
 The input to the problem is an undirected graph G with positive edge lengths,

3
00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:10,665
 and the output is a tree T with minimum weight.

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,420
 Now let's test your knowledge of P and NP.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,150
 So the first question is,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,295
 is the MST problem in NP?

7
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:21,595
 Mark whether this statement is true or false.

8
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:24,390
 The second question is whether the MST problem is in the

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,390
 class P. Is that statement true or false?
