Prove reverse imp.: satisfying 3SAT assigns. -> solution to subset-sum. Given satisfying assigns. for f, construct solution S: if X_ith true, add V_ith to S; if X_ith false, add V_ith prime to S. Only one of V_ith or V_ith prime added to S, ensuring correct ith digit in T. For jth clause (since at least one lit. satisfied), corresponding nums. ensure sum of 1, 2, or 3 in digit n+j of T, which is 3. Can use S_j and/or S_j prime to reach sum of 3. Thus, all digits of T correct, providing solution to subset-sum. Reduction proven correct.
