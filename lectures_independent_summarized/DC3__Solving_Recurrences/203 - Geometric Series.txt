Exploring a geometric series with a positive constant alpha as an example: term dominance determined by alpha's value relative to 1 in solving recurrences within big O notation. If alpha > 1, last term dominatesâ€”the series is O(alpha to the power of j). If alpha < 1, the series is dominated by the first term, thus O(1). For alpha = 1, all terms equal and series is O(k+1). Analyzed recurrence had alpha = 2, last term dominated. In merge sort, with alpha = 1, series results in O(k). Median finding algorithm example had alpha = 3/4, making the series O(1).
