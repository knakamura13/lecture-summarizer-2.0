Considering the recurrence relation T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n), O(n) is defined by a constant c yielding T(n) ≈ 4T(n/2) + cn with the base case for inputs of size 1 being O(1), which is equated with c. The recurrence is restated as T(n) ≤ cn + 4T(n/2) after which T(n/2) is replaced iteratively by its recurrence expression; this process generates terms like cn with other terms being reduced by powers of 2 and multiplied by powers of 4. This iterative substitution leads to a geometric series in c times n (cn(1 + 2 + 2^2 + ...)) combined with a decreasingly scaled recurrence term (4^3 T(n/2^3)), indicating a pattern consistent with a geometric series.
