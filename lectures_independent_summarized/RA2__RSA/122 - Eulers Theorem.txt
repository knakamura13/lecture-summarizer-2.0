Euler's theorem extends Fermat's little theorem from prime numbers to any positive integer N by asserting Z^φ(N) ≡ 1 mod N, given Z and N are relatively prime (GCD(Z,N)=1). φ(N), Euler's totient function, signifies the count of numbers ≤ N that are coprime to N. For a prime P, φ(P) equals P-1, mirroring the case in Fermat's theorem: raising Z to P-1 yields a remainder of 1 when divided by P. Euler's theorem thus generalizes Fermat's by applying a similar concept to a broader set of numbers, N, not limited to primes.
