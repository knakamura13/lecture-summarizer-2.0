1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
 So let's ignore Carmichael numbers for now since they're relatively rare.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,780
 Let's assume that every composite number r,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,670
 has at least one non-trivial Fermat witness.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,815
 If we assume that it has at least one non-trivial witness,

5
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:16,705
 how many witnesses does it have, actually?

6
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:20,545
 How prevalent are these non-trivial witnesses?

7
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:21,870
 The key fact is that,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,425
 if r has at least one non-trivial Fermat witness,

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,580
 then there are many non-trivial Fermat witnesses.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,385
 In fact, if we look at the set of possible witnesses,

11
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:34,380
 one through r minus one,

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,960
 then at least half the numbers in this set are Fermat witnesses.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,495
 Now, this is a relatively simple fact to prove and it's a very nice proof.

14
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:43,975
 The proof is in the book.

15
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:48,000
 But let's get the proof for now and let's try to use this, Lemma,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,975
 to have an algorithm for checking whether a number is prime or not,

17
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:54,660
 when we ignore Carmichael numbers.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,880
 So we assume that a composite number has at least one non-trivial witness.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,170
 Then this Lemma tells us that at least half the numbers in this set are Fermat witnesses,

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,340
 are witnesses to the fact that r is composite.

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,745
 Can we use this fact now to get a test for whether r is composite or not?

22
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,255
 The point is that when r is prime,

23
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,025
 all of these numbers,

24
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,830
 when we raise them to the power r minus one is congruent

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,250
 one mod r. And when r is composite,

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,230
 then at least half these numbers,

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,030
 when we raise them to the power r minus one is,

28
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,180
 are not congruent one mod r. So how are we gonna check whether a number is prime or not?

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,445
 We're going to take a z, from this set,

30
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,465
 and raise it to the power r minus one.

31
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:37,465
 Look at mod r and see whether it's one or not.
