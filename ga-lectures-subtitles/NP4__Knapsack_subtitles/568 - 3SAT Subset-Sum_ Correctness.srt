1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
 What we've sketched so far and what we'll formally prove

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,655
 now is that the subset sum instance that we constructed

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:11,220
 has a solution if and only if the original 3SAT input is satisfiable.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,985
 It's going to prove that we did a value reduction.

5
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,055
 Let's start with the forward direction.

6
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:19,950
 Let's take a solution S to this subset sum instance.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,083
 So we know that if we sum up the numbers in S,

8
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:26,390
 it sums up to exactly T. Let's first look at the first N digits.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,975
 These correspond to the N variables X1 through Xn.

10
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,780
 We know that T has a one in digit I.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,790
 In order to get a one in digit I,

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,910
 we have to include Vi or Vi prime in our subset S, but not both.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,440
 If we include both we get a two n digit i.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,085
 And if we include neither,

15
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,900
 we get a sum of zero in digit i.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,690
 So the only way to get a sum of exactly 1 in digit

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,635
 i is to include exactly one of Vi and Vi prime.

18
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,550
 If we include Vi in our subset S,

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,305
 then we set the variable Xi to true.

20
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:03,810
 If we include Vi prime in our subset S then we set the variable Xi to false.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,770
 So from this solution to the subset sum problem, we get an assignment.

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,585
 We get a true false assignment for the variables.

23
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,540
 Why is this a satisfying assignment?

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,540
 Well, to see that we'll look at the remaining digits.
