1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 Let alpha to note ZJ hat star.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,480
 What we've shown so far is that the probability that this clause CJ satisfied

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,650
 is at least one minus one minus over alpha over K to the K. Now,

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,825
 once again, we want to get this alpha outside of this power.

5
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,130
 We want to make it a linear function of alpha.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,855
 Let's look at this function of alpha.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,475
 Let's define F of alpha to be this right hand side.

8
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,820
 And our claim is that F of alpha,

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,550
 so this right hand side here,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,930
 is at least some constant times alpha.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,855
 It's a constant in the sense it's independent of alpha.

12
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:39,150
 It does depend on K, the size of this clause.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,570
 Now, what does that constant there?

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,180
 Well, it's going to be similar to this without the alpha.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,590
 It's going to be one minus quantity one minus one over K raised to the Kth power.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,910
 Once we prove that, then we can apply that

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,930
 here and we get that this is at least this quantity,

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,890
 which is this constant times alpha.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,355
 We got the alpha outside of the power so it's now linear in alpha.

20
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:04,260
 It's linear in this Z.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,806
 Now, how do we prove this claim?

22
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:10,325
 First off, you take the second derivative and you prove that it's negative.

23
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:12,400
 Therefore, this function is concave.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,610
 Since F alpha is a concave function,

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,490
 it's going to look something like this.

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,470
 We're trying to relate F of alpha,

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,230
 this curve, to this linear function.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,930
 Let's denote this linear function is beta-alpha,

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,120
 so this quantity here is beta.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,515
 Let's look at this line beta-alpha.

31
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:32,090
 For large values of alpha it might not be bigger.

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,010
 But notice, what values of alpha are we interested in?

33
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,020
 We're interested in alphas between zero and one,

34
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,070
 so we only need this claim for values of alpha between zero and one.

35
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,327
 So, since it's a concave function it's got one peak.

36
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:51,070
 If we look at the end points that we're interested in, one and zero,

37
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,190
 and if we prove that this curve is above this line at these two points,

38
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,440
 zero and one, then it's also above at every intermediate point.

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,640
 So once we take the second derivative and prove it's

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,180
 concave then it suffices to check the point zero alpha,

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,235
 equals zero and alpha equals one.

42
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:09,885
 And if you plug in alpha equals zero,

43
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,550
 we get zero on both sides,

44
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,260
 and alpha equals one,

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,260
 it's straightforward to check that that's also true.
