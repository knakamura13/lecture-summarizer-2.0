Executing max-flow on a flow network yields a flow of max size, equivalent to the min capacity S,T cut. Understanding S,T cuts involves examining partitions and cut capacities, focusing on edges from set F (foreground) to set B (background), excluding edges from B to F. Assigning pixels to F yields edges to sink T (capacity B,I), assigning pixels to B gives edges from source S (capacity F,J). For each undirected edge with ends in F and B, its directed edge's capacity is P,I,J. Summing capacities of edges crossing the cut equals W prime (F,B), the sum of edge capacities from S to B, I to T, and separation penalty P,I,J for F and B assignments. The goal: minimize W prime. Running max-flow and finding the min S,T cut achieves this, identifying the partition that minimizes W prime.
