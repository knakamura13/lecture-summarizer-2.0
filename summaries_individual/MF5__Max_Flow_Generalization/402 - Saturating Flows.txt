Max flow size in a graph is limited by the total capacity out of source S-prime or into sink T-prime, which is defined by the total demand D in the original network. Total demand is calculated by summing the demand on edges or at vertices. For the constructed graph G-prime, total capacity from S-prime equals total demand into vertices; similarly, capacity into T-prime equals total demand out of vertices, both equating to D. A flow F-prime is saturating if it reaches this maximum value D, fully using edge capacities out of S-prime and into T-prime. A feasible flow exists in the original network G if and only if G-prime has a saturating flow. Finding a feasible flow involves transforming the problem into a max-flow problem, running max-flow on G-prime, and checking if the max-flow equals D. If saturating, a feasible flow F for G can be constructed from the saturating flow F-prime in G-prime, thus solving the feasible flow problem by leveraging solutions to the max-flow problem.
