Before we dive into the proof of the Lemma, let's take a quick quiz on some basic properties of roots of unity. We saw just before about Omega_n to the negative one, the inverse of Omega_n. To make sure you understand that let's look at Omega_n square. What's the inverse of this number? And don't simply write it with negative two in the exponent, write in some manner so that you have a positive exponent.
