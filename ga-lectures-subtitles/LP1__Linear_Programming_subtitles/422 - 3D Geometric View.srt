1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,565
 Let's recap our LP once again.

2
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:07,290
 Our objective function is to maximize x1 plus 6x2 plus 10x3.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,915
 Subject to the following seven constraints.

4
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,965
 We have the two demand constraints.

5
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:13,585
 We have the supply constraint,

6
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:17,730
 the packaging constraint and finally the non-negativity constraint.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,850
 Now, let's take a look at this geometrically.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,990
 Now, we have three variables,

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,300
 so we're going to line three dimensional space.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,460
 Now, if we had equality for one of these constraints,

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,750
 there would be a hyperplane,

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,600
 a three dimensional hyperplane.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,295
 Now, within inequality we're taking one side of that hyperplane.

14
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:34,295
 So that's a half space.

15
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:37,890
 So we're looking at the intersection of these seven half spaces.

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,355
 This is a geometric view of the feasible region.

17
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:44,880
 The points in this ten polyhedron are the feasible axes.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,560
 These are the points which satisfy all seven constraints.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,660
 Now, notice this is a convex set,

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,820
 so it can't go down and then back up.

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,710
 Convexity is an important property for the algorithms to solve linear programs.

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,890
 Now, let's take a look at the general formulation of linear programs and then

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:00,890
 we'll come back to this example and we'll figure out the optimum for this example.
