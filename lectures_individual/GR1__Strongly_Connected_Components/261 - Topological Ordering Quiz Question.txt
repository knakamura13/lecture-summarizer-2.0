Now here's an example of a graph on five vertices. Why don't you go ahead and give a topological ordering for this graph. There are five vertices, so let's write down the vertices in order so that all edges go from left to right. Now this graph happens to have multiple topological orderings. How many topological orderings does it in fact have? To make sure you understand topological orderings, why don't you go ahead and specify the number of topological orderings which are valid for this graph.
