00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,245
 In this lesson, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:05,115
 connectivity algorithms using algorithms based on DFS.

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,180
 DFS of course, refers to depth-first search.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,670
 We'll start off by reviewing DFS for undirected graphs and

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,295
 look at the algorithm for determining connected components and undirected graphs.

6
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:17,545
 That algorithm is probably familiar to many of you.

7
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:20,700
 After that, we'll look at DFS for directed graphs and our goal is

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,500
 to determine the analog of connected components for directed graphs.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,175
 We begin by looking at DAGs.

10
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,950
 DAGs are directed acyclic graphs.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,970
 Acyclic means that it has no cycles.

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,380
 We'll see how the topologically sort DAGs.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,735
 What this means is that, we can order the vertices,

14
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:38,230
 say from left to right,

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,075
 so that all edges go left to right.

16
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,470
 Now, this algorithm may be familiar to many of you,

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,920
 but we'll use it to derive some intuition for

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,545
 our more sophisticated algorithms for general directed graphs.

19
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:51,055
 For general directed graphs,

20
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,820
 we are going to be looking to find the SCCs.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,530
 These are the strongly connected components.

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,335
 This is the analog of connected components for directed graphs.

23
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,000
 The algorithm for finding SCCs is really sweet.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,865
 It's just two DFS.

25
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,140
 Actually, it's the same DFS algorithm we found

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,480
 before for undirected graphs and we just run

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,880
 it two times and we'll find this strongly connected components of any directed graph.

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,750
 Now, it's a very simple algorithm but we're going to get there a bit slowly.

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,045
 We're going to go through all of these steps in order to derive some intuition

30
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:24,270
 before we get to this more general algorithm for general director graphs.

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,320
 So let's start with undirected graphs and let me remind you about

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 the DFS algorithm that you've probably seen a million times.
