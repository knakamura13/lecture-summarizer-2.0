Developed a strongly connected component (SCC) algorithm for directed graphs. Initial step is to reverse the input graph. Post that, deploy DFS on the reversed graph to identify the vertex with the highest post order number, indicating a sink SCC in the original graph. Next, arrange the original graph's vertices by decreasing post order numbers obtained from the DFS on the reversed graph, aligning with topological ordering. The final step involves running DFS on the original graph, now ordered by these post order numbers. The process uses an algorithm akin to that for undirected connected components, where we assign a connected component number (CCnum) to mark each SCC during DFS. The result produces SCCs numbered in topological order. The method effectively utilizes the undirected components algorithm, adapted for directed graphs to identify and order SCCs.
