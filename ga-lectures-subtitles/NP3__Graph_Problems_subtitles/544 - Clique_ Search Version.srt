1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
 Now let's formally define the Clique problem.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,625
 The input to the clique problem is an undirected graph G,

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:10,420
 and it goal little g. The output from the clique problem is a subset of vertices S,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,310
 which is a clique of size at least

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,810
 g. Now we're trying to find the largest clique possible.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,420
 Therefore we're trying to output a clique of size at least

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,143
 g. If we outputted a clique of size at most g,

8
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,475
 that would be quite trivial,

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,250
 because we could always output the empty set.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,675
 Now we output such a clique if one exists,

11
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:32,740
 and if no such clique exists in the graph, then we output NO.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,930
 And what we're going to prove now,

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:33,930
 is that the Clique problem is NP-complete.
