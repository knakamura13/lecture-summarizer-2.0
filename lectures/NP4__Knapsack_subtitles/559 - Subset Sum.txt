The input to the subset sum problem are n positive integers which we'll denote as A_1 through A_n, and one additional integer, t. Our goal is to find a subset of numbers which sum up to exactly t. So we want the sum over the indices in this subset of the corresponding numbers to be equal to exactly t. We output such a subset if it exists and otherwise, we output NO. This is a great practice problem for dynamic programming. Using dynamic programming, we can solve this problem in order n times t time. If you want practice with dynamic programming, I suggest you
