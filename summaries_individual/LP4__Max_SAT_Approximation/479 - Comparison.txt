Examined Max-SAT performance on exact K-SAT formulas with two algos: a simple randomized assignment (prob. for each var. is 1/2 true/false) and an LP-based scheme (integer lin. prog. relaxed to lin. prog., then rounded). For K=1 (uni clauses), simple algo yields 1/2 approx. factor, LP gives perfect 1. At K=2, both algos yield 3/4 approx. factor. For K=3 and beyond, simple algo outperforms LP (simple algo approx. 7/8 for K=3; LP approx. 0.704). Crucially, best algo for any K gives at least 3/4 approx. Combining two algos can achieve at least 3/4 approx. regardless of K.
