1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230
 Take a look at this lemma that we're trying to prove.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,990
 Look at a clause Cj and let's say Cj is of size K and let's

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,525
 suppose the clause is X1 or X2 and so on, up to XK.

4
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:14,720
 So assuming all the literals are positive form.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,410
 Let's just do the analysis for

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,120
 this simpler case and the same approach will apply to the general clause.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,250
 And in fact since we're just looking at

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,085
 this clause in isolation and because of the symmetry,

9
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:30,480
 we can always convert this clause to appear in this form.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,310
 Now, what was the LP constraint for this clause?

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,460
 Let's look at it in terms of the optimal solution to the LP.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,580
 So variable X1 has this variable in the LP Y1_hat_star.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,530
 We want that if this is 0,

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,140
 meaning X1 is false and if that's the case for all K of these variables,

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,820
 then we want that this variable Zj_hat_star is 0 in this case.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,970
 So if all of these literals are unsatisfying,

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,974
 meaning all these variables are set to false then all of these Y's are set to 0,

18
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:06,845
 then Zj must be 0 corresponding to this clause being unsatisfied.

19
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,700
 This is the LP constraint.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,250
 Now, we're trying to analyze the probability that this clause is

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,190
 satisfied after the randomized rounding procedure.

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,045
 This is of course the same as 1 minus the probability that this clause is unsatisfying.

23
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,520
 What's the probability that this clause is unsatisfied?

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,115
 Well, what's the probability that all these variables are set to false?

25
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:28,210
 So we're going to look at the product over these K variables.

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,180
 The I one is set to false with probably one minus Yi_hat_star.

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,830
 Now, for your call dilemma,

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,420
 we're trying to show that the probability that this clause is satisfied is at least 1

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,395
 minus 1 over E times this quantity Zj_hat_star.

30
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,140
 What we know is that

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,020
 the probably it satisfied equals 1 minus this product, of these Yi's.

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,625
 Now we know how to relate the sum of these Yi's to this Zj_star.

33
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,505
 How do we relate the product to the sum?

34
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:06,040
 So we want to relate this product to this sum and then we can relate it to Zj_hat_star.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,570
 To relate this product to this sum,

36
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:08,570
 we're going to use the geometric mean, arithmetic mean, inequality.
