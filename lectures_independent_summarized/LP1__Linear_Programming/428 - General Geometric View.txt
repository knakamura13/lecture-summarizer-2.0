In an n-dimensional space with a large n, we're considering a system with n variables and m constraints, in addition to n non-negativity constraints, yielding a total of n + m constraints. A feasible region is defined, which is delineated by the intersection of n + m half-spaces corresponding to each constraint, resulting in a convex polyhedron. The vertices of this polyhedron are its corners, and determining a vertex is posed as a query to be addressed.
