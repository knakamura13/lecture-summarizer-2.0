1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,995
 Now, how do we find the optimal point?

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:07,549
 Our goal is to maximize this function x1 plus 6x2.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:13,470
 So, let's look at this line x1 plus 6x2 equal C. We're trying to maximize the C,

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,144
 which intersects this feasible region.

5
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:18,510
 So, let's find the maximum value of this C,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,065
 where this linear function intersects the feasible region.

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,855
 So, let's take a look at this function,

8
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:27,750
 this linear function for different values of C. Now,

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,620
 here's the line x1 plus 6x2 equals 600.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,485
 Now, all these points on the line which intersect the feasible region,

11
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:42,149
 so these points, all satisfy the five constraints and achieve profit of 600.

12
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,520
 Now, clearly these are not optimal because we can move up this line.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,465
 Now, we can think of moving up this line into

14
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:51,200
 the last point when we intersect the feasible region.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,030
 Now, it turns out the maximum value of C for which

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,409
 this line intersects the feasible region is C equals 1300.

17
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,049
 This line x1 plus 6x2 equals

18
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,021
 1300 intersects the feasible region at this corner of this polygon,

19
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,935
 this vertex of this feasible region.

20
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,590
 This is the point 100, 200.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,614
 So, we know the optimum is at the point x1 equals

22
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:19,530
 100 and x2 equals 200 and that achieves a profit of 1300.

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,989
 Now, this was a simple two dimensional example.

24
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,450
 Let's look at a simple three dimensional example and then we'll

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,450
 get some idea of how it generalizes to higher dimensions.
