Explored a linear programming example with products A, B, C, each with associated profits: $1 for A, $6 for B, $10 for C. Demand is capped at 300/day for A, 200/day for B, and unlimited for C. Production is limited to 1000 hours/day, with A, B, and C requiring 1, 3, and 2 hours respectively to produce. An added packaging constraint allows a max of 500 units/day, with A needing no packaging, B one unit, and C three units per product.
