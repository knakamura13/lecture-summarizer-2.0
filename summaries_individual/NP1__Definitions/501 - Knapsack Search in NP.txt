The new version of the Knapsack problem falls into the NP class, as checking a proposed solution is a process that can be performed in polynomial time. Verification involves ensuring the total weight does not exceed the given capacity (B) and that the total value meets or surpasses a specified goal (g). These validations require summing a series of numbers up to n, which can be computed in O(n) time. However, accounting for the actual magnitude of the weights and values, the computational time to sum these numbers depends on the number of bitsâ€”specifically, O(nlogW), where W is the sum of weights. Since the input size is determined by the logarithm of the total weights and values, the computational process is confirmed to be polynomial in the input size. Thus, the Knapsack-search version is correctly classified in NP, as a solution can indeed be verified efficiently.
