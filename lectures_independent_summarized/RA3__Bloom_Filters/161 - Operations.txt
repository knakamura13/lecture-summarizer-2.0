The data structure supports two operations: inserting a potential password (X) to a dictionary of unacceptable passwords, and querying if X is within this dictionary. If X is found to be unacceptable, a "YES" response is consistently correct. The issue arises when X is acceptable and should receive a "NO" response; however, there's a small rate of false positives where an acceptable password is incorrectly identified as unacceptable. The rate of these false positives needs to be defined and managed.
