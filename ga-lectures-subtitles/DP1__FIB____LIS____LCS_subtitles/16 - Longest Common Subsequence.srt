1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,185
 Our next dynamic programming example is Longest Common Subsequence.

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:07,080
 Which we'll use the shorthand LCS.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,585
 The input to the problem is two strings,

4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,665
 which will denote as X and Y.

5
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:13,080
 And for simplicity, for now,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,095
 we'll keep them both of the same length.

7
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:17,550
 Our goal is to find the length of

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,020
 the longest string which appears as a subsequence in both X and Y,

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,560
 and notice that we're trying to find the subsequence,

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,770
 not a sub-string, and which simply trying to output the length of the string.

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,015
 And if we can find the length,

12
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,470
 we can use that to find

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,470
 an actual string which appears as a subsequence and we'll see how to do that at the end.
