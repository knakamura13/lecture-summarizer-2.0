Vertex cover problem is NP-complete; proved in two steps. First, vertex cover, S, verification in polynomial time: checking each edge to confirm at least one endpoint in S (done in O(n+m)) and S size validation (done in O(n)). These show S as a potential solution in polynomial time. Second, must demonstrate vertex cover problem's equivalency to other NP-complete problems. Chose independent set for reduction, being a graph problem similar to clique. The two-stage proof confirms the NP-completeness of the vertex cover problem.
