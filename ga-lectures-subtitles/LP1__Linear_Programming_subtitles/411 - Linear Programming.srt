00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
 Linear programming is a very general technique for solving optimization problems.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,110
 It handles any problem that can be formulated as

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,930
 an optimization over a set of variables with

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,570
 a goal known as the objective function and

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,895
 the constraints can all be expressed as linear functions of the variables.

6
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:20,605
 We'll see that max flow can be formulated as a linear program.

7
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:25,830
 Also, we'll see that many problems from operations research can be expressed as LPs.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,540
 We'll describe the general idea of

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,585
 the simplex algorithm which is widely used for solving LPs.

10
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:35,060
 We'll take a closer look at one of the beautiful aspects

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,567
 of linear programming, LP duality.

12
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:42,975
 We'll explain what LP duality is and some of the useful consequences for us.

13
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:46,765
 Finally, we'll look at an application of LP to approximation algorithms.

14
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:49,100
 We'll use linear programming to design

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,100
 an approximation algorithm to the classic set problem.
