so when exactly are their multiplicative inverses or not the general theorem is that X inverse mod an exists if and only if X and n have no common divisor so the greatest common divisor is one GC D stands for a greatest common divisor so if they're both even then 2 is a divisor of both so the GCD is at least 2 might be bigger what's at least 2 now just some terminology when the greatest GCD of X and n is 1 so they have no common divisor then we say that X and n are relatively prime with respect to each other they feel like primes to each other for instance 9 and 14 neither one is prime but with respect to each other they have no common divisors so they feel like Prime's to each other so the theorem says that if these numbers are prime relatively prime to each other then there is an inverse but if they have a common divisor then there is no inverse let's look at why this theorem holds but before we get into it let's look at some basic properties about inverses
