1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,175
 Our first topic is dynamic programming.

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:05,640
 This is one of my favorite topics to teach because it is extremely useful.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,635
 Students often have some trouble with it initially,

4
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:10,334
 but with enough practice it will sink in and actually,

5
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:12,660
 they will seem quite easy once you get the hang of it.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,205
 I'll do my best to show you how I solve dynamic programming problems.

7
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:18,060
 And, from there the key to really mastering

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,930
 dynamic programming is to do lots and lots of practice problems.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,480
 The homework is just a start.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,673
 Do additional problems from the textbook,

11
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,445
 and from other algorithms textbooks,

12
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,554
 and from other courses you can find on the web.

13
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:31,035
 We'll start with the toy example,

14
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:35,350
 computing Fibonacci numbers, to illustrate the basic idea of dynamic programming.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,840
 Then, we'll dive into a variety of

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,510
 example problems to get a feel for the different styles of

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,830
 DP algorithms;- Longest increasing subs sequence (LIS),

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,480
 longest common subsequence (LCS) the classic Knapsack Problem,

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
 chain matrix multiplication and finally,

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:50,940
 we'll look at a few shortest path algorithms using DP.
