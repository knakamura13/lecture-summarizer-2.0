Evaluated probability of a specific bit being zero in a database scenario: (1 - 1/N)^(MK). Replaced this with an exponential for small A where A approximated as (1 - A) using Taylor series, applicable for large N. Exponential approximation yields: e^(-MK/N) or e^(-K/C), simplifying analysis of false positive rate. C is the hash table size to database size ratio. False positive definition: probability that element X not in database is falsely reported present due to K corresponding bits being set to one by other insertions. Calculated false positive probability as (1 - e^(-K/C))^K. Objective: optimize K to minimize false positives, considering trade-offs of small or large K values. Plan: derive optimal K by differentiating the false positive probability function and setting it to zero.
