00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 We've seen how to show that the 3SAT problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,505
 Now let's take a look at a few graph theory examples.

3
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:09,495
 We'll start with the Independent sets problem,

4
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:12,590
 then will show that the clique problem is also NP-complete.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,345
 And finally, we'll show that the vertex cover problem is NP-complete.

6
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:19,230
 I'll define for you each of these combinatorial problems as we go along,

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,025
 in case you're not familiar with them.

8
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:21,025
 Let's dive into the independent sets problem.
