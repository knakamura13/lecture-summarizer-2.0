Converting SAT problem with 4 variables and 3 clauses (C1, C2, C3) into a 3-SAT problem: C1 and C3 remain unchanged as they are already valid for 3-SAT. C2, which has 4 literals, is modified by introducing a new variable y, splitting C2 into two clauses of at most three literals each: (¬x2 ∨ x3 ∨ y) and (¬y ∨ ¬x1 ∨ ¬x4), labeled as C2'. The transformation maintains the satisfiability equivalence between the original clause C2 and the new pair C2', ensuring the resulting formula is a valid 3-SAT representation with only clauses of size 3 or less.
