00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
 Let's take a quick quiz to make sure you're familiar with multiplying

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,060
 polynomials and let's consider the polynomial A(x),

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,775
 which is 1 + 2x + 3x squared.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:13,125
 And B(x), let's define as 2 - x + 4x squared.

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,642
 So the vector of coefficients for A(x) is (1, 2,

6
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:20,275
 3), and the vector for B(x) is (2, -1, 4).

7
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:20,275
 And now compute the convolution of A and B.
