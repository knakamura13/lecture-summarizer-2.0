00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
 Now here is one valid topological ordering, X,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,160
 then Y, then Z, then U,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,040
 then W. Notice that all the edges go left to right.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,555
 Now how many valid topological orderings are there?

5
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:13,845
 Well, I can move U to any of these last three positions.

6
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:16,140
 So there are three choices for the position of U.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,135
 After I specify the position for U,

8
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,330
 then the position for Z and W are forced because Z has

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:21,330
 to come before W. So this graph has three topological.
