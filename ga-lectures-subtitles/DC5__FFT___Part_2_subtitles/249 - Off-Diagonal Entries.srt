1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 Now let's look at the off-diagonal entries of this product matrix.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,360
 So we want to show that entries k,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,830
 j equals zero when k is not equal to j.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,946
 Because if k equals j,

5
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:12,380
 that's the diagonal entry.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,640
 And we just showed that equals n. But,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,050
 if they're not equal, we'll show it equals zero.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,050
 Here are the pair of matrices once again.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,910
 We're again going to take row k and now we're going to take column j over here.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,490
 The kth row of this matrix is the same as

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,635
 before and the jth column of this matrix is this vector.

12
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,850
 When we take the dot product of these two vectors we get the

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,945
 following one plus omega sub n to the j

14
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:38,070
 minus k. And then we get powers of

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,805
 omega sub n to the j minus k. Well, let's simplify this.

16
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:44,380
 Let's do a change of variables to simplify it.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,580
 Let's let omega be omega sub n to the j minus

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,575
 k then the dot product of these vectors can be simplified as one,

19
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:56,460
 first term is omega sub n to the j minus k which is

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,230
 omega plus omega squared up to omega to the n minus 1.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,795
 Now what do we know about omega.

22
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:05,675
 Well, it's the nth root of unity raised to some power.

23
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:10,215
 So it's still an nth root of unity and we know that the exponent is not zero.

24
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:11,615
 Since it's not zero,

25
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,660
 then this thing is not 1.

26
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,895
 So omega is an nth root of unity it's not one.

27
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:18,890
 So we can apply our claim.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,810
 We're just doing powers of the nth root of unity.

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,015
 We know for any nth root of unity which is not one.

30
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:26,955
 If we take powers of it,

31
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,335
 what do we get? We get zero.

32
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:33,860
 Which proves this off-diagonal entries are zero as we desire.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:33,860
 And that completes the proof of the lemma.
