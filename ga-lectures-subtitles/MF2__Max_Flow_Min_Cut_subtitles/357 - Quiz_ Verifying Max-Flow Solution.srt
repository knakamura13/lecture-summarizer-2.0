1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,085
 The solution is linear time.

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:07,965
 It takes O(n+m) time to check whether a particular flow f is maximum or not.

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:11,560
 This follows as a consequence of the lemma we stated on the previous slide.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,320
 For a flow f*,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,105
 if there's no augmenting path,

6
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:20,055
 no path from s to t in the residual graph for this particular flow,

7
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:23,350
 then this flow f* is a max-flow.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,980
 So to check whether f is a max-flow,

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,860
 we build its residual graph which takes linear time,

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,090
 O(n+m) time, and then we check for a path from s to t in this residual graph.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,795
 To do that, we simply run DFS from s to check whether t is reachable from

12
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:45,562
 s. What this lemma says is if there is no path from s to t in this residual graph,

13
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:48,935
 then this particular flow f is a max-flow.

14
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,310
 So we output yes.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,420
 Now what if there is a path from s to t?

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,485
 Well, then we can augment a flow along this path.

17
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,230
 And then we get a flow of larger value.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,590
 And therefore, this particular flow f is not

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,880
 a max-flow because we can build a flow of larger size.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,255
 Now we'll get back to the proof of this lemma shortly.

21
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:11,850
 But let's go back first to the max-flow min-cut theorem,

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:11,850
 and let's see what min-cut actually means.
