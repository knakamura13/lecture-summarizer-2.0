1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
 In the Edmonds-Karp algorithm there's only one distinction.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,390
 When we check for an st-path in the residual network,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,130
 we have to use BFS.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,790
 We cannot use DFS.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,580
 The running time analysis assumes that we're using BFS to find this path.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,058
 That's the only difference between Edmonds-Karp and Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

7
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,041
 Now, a running time analysis will not assume that the capacities are integer values,

8
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,885
 so we can remove this assumption.

9
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,779
 All that's required is that the capacities are positive.

10
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,830
 Before we dive into the running time analysis,

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,580
 let's look at one basic property of

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,130
 the Edmonds-Karp algorithm and also the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,980
 Notice that the residual network has to change by at least one edge in every round.

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,730
 In particular, at least one edge reaches full capacity.

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,080
 We augment along P until we reach the full capacity of at least one edge on that path.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,430
 Now, that edge, which reaches its full capacity in the residual graph,

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,545
 will be removed from the residual graph in the next stage.

18
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:55,995
 Now, that edge might be a forward edge or a backward edge,

19
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:59,850
 but regardless it will be removed from the residual graph in the next stage.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,610
 Now, there may be additional edges which are removed and there

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,565
 might be other edges which are added back into the residual network,

22
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,980
 and we're going to need some understanding of which edges are

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,805
 added in or removed from the residual network.

24
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:10,805
 But one key property is that at least one edge is removed in every stage.
