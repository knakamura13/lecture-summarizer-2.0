Focusing on a computational task involving a vector a, representing the coefficients of a polynomial A(x), with the goal to compute A(x)'s value at endpoints x1 through x2n. The selection of these endpoints is critical. A proposed approach assumes these endpoints exhibit a plus-minus property, meaning the first n points are the negatives of the subsequent points (Xn+1 = -X1, Xn+2 = -X2, ..., X2n = -Xn). This property is central to our methodology for endpoint selection.
