1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,675
 The second key property holds when n is a power of two.

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:06,605
 If we look at the nth roots squared,

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:08,740
 we get the n over second roots.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,011
 So we take the jth of the nth roots,

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,230
 so omega sub n to the jth power,

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,780
 and we square it.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,775
 So in polar, we're taking the point one comma two pi over n times J squared.

8
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,705
 So we simply double the angle.

9
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:28,815
 So we get the point one comma two pi over n over two times J,

10
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:33,240
 which is omega sub n over two to the Jth power.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,055
 So the Jth of the nth roots squared is the Jth of the n over second roots.

12
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:45,467
 And similarly, if we take the n over second plus Jth of the nth roots and we square it,

13
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,950
 well, this is just the opposite of this.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,848
 So when we square the negative of it we get the same thing.

15
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,950
 So why do we need this property that the nth root squared or the n over second roots?

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,320
 Well, we're going to take this polynomial A of x,

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,720
 and we want to evaluate at the nth roots.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,440
 Now these nth roots satisfy the plus minus properties,

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,630
 so we can do a divide and conquer approach.

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,050
 But then, what do we need?

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,240
 We need to evaluate A even and A odd at the square of these nth roots,

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,165
 which will be the n over second roots.

23
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:19,225
 So this subproblem is of the exact same form as the original problem.

24
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:22,275
 In order to evaluate A of x at the nth roots,

25
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:25,110
 we need to evaluate these two subproblems,

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,380
 A even and A odd at the n over second roots.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,920
 And then we can recursively continue this algorithm.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,425
 Now we're all set to do our FFT algorithm,

29
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:36,870
 and the end points where we choose to evaluate

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,870
 the polynomial A of x are the nth roots of unity.
