00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
 In this lecture we're going to talk about hashing and we're

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,715
 going to describe a popular technique called bloom filters.

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,005
 Before we get into hashing,

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:09,980
 we're going to talk about a toy problem, balls into bins.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,525
 We are going to throw balls randomly into a set of bins.

6
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,840
 We'll do some simple probabilistic analysis of

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,970
 this problem and this will give us some intuition about the design of hashing schemes.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,835
 One of the neat ideas we're going to see with the balls and bin's problems,

9
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,455
 is the power of two choices.

10
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:30,605
 This is going to motivate some of our more sophisticated hashing schemes.

11
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,165
 After we look at the toy problem balls into bins,

12
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:36,638
 then we'll look at the traditional hashing scheme; chain hashing.

13
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:40,575
 And then we'll look at our more sophisticated scheme, bloom filters.

14
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:40,575
 So let's dive into the balls into bins.
