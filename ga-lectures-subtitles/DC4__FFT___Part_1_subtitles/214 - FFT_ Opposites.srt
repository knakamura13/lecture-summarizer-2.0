1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,955
 Now here's the smaller computational task that we're focusing on now.

2
00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:06,055
 We're given this vector a.

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:10,710
 These correspond to the coefficients for the polynomial A(x) and we want to compute

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,110
 the value of this polynomial A(x) at two endpoints, x1, through x2n.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,320
 And the key point is that we get to choose these two endpoints x1 through x2n.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,130
 How do we choose them?

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,555
 Well that's our main task.

8
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,890
 A crucial observation is suppose that

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,245
 the first n points are opposite of the next endpoints.

10
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:33,555
 In other words Xn+1 is -X1.

11
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,930
 Xn+2 two is -X2, and so on.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,705
 The last one is X2n is -Xn.

13
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:43,155
 Let's suppose that our two endpoints satisfy this property,

14
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:45,075
 which we'll call the plus minus property,

15
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:45,075
 and let's see how this plus minus property
