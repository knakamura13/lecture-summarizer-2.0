We're looking first at this recurrence, T(n) = 4T (n/2) +O (n). Let's start by getting rid of the big O notation. Order n means that there's some constant c so that t of n is almost 4 times T of n over 2 plus cn. So we replaced order n by most cn. We also have the base case, let's say the base cases of size 1 since the inputs of size 1 it must solve in order one time. So we can place that order 1 by a constant c and notice we can use the same constant c for both of these by taking the max of these two constants and calling that c. Let's solve for T of n. So I simply restated the recurrence, though for convenience I rearranged the terms so T of n is the most c times n plus 4T of n and over 2. Now let's replace T of n over 2 by this recurrence. So replace n by n over 2 so we get this term c times n again plus we get 4 times and then let's replace T of n over 2 with this expression. So we have 4 times T of and we're placing n by n over 2 so we get n over 2 squared and then for the last term we're replacing n by n over 2 so instead of c times n, we get c times n over 2. Now let's rearrange this and it collects similar terms. So we want to collect c times n with 4 times c times n over 2. So these have a common factor of c times n, this term is 1, this term is 4 over 2 times c times n and then finally, the last term is 4 squared times T of n over two squared. Now let's repeat this process and replace T of n over 4 by this expression. Now we're replacing n by n over 2 squared. So the first term becomes 4T of n over 2 cubed and the last term becomes c times n over two squared. Rearranging once again so bringing this term over here. So we have T of n is the most c times n times the quantity 1 plus 4 halves plus 4 halves squared plus 4 cubed times T of n and over 2 cubed. Notice we're starting to get a geometric series here.
