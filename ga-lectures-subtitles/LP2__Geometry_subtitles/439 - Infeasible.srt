1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,625
 Let's consider an LP in standard form,

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:08,160
 and we'd like to figure out whether there are some axis which satisfy these constraints.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,445
 So, this has nothing to do with the objective function.

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,450
 Simply looking at the constraints,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,080
 is there any point x satisfying all of the constraints?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,350
 So, is the feasible region empty or not?

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,205
 Let's make a new variable z.

8
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:22,350
 Now, X was a vector of size n,

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,805
 so, it consisted of n variables.

10
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:27,365
 That's not a vector, that's just a single variable.

11
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,430
 Now, consider one of the constraints here,

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,100
 a1x1 plus a2x2 and so on,

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,285
 up to anxn is at most little b.

14
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:41,145
 Now, is there a solution to this under the non-activity constraint?

15
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:42,765
 Well, there may or may not be.

16
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:47,365
 But suppose, we take the same constraint and we add in z to the left hand side.

17
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:51,126
 We keep the non-negativity constrains for the variables x1 through xn,

18
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:53,625
 but z is unrestricted.

19
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,395
 So, it can take on positive or negative values.

20
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:59,495
 In this case, there is always a solution to this new equation.

21
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:02,640
 Why? Simply set z small enough,

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,430
 and then, this is trivially satisfied.

23
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,269
 So, let's think of z as negative infinity though,

24
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,275
 in fact it's a finite number.

25
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:12,090
 It suffices to take a small enough number relative

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,345
 to the numbers a1 through an and little b.

27
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:19,450
 So, this constraint is trivially satisfied for a small enough z.

28
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,943
 Now, the question is, whether there is a solution to this equation,

29
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:24,570
 when z is at least zero.

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,220
 If we can find a solution to this new equation,

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,050
 where z is non-negative then,

32
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,870
 we can drop z and we still have this condition satisfied.

33
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,760
 So, our original constrain is equivalent to

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,780
 the new constrain with the extra condition that z is at least zero.

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,250
 But if we drop this constraint,

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,110
 that z is non-negative then,

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,180
 there's trivially a solution to this.

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,010
 So, we have a starting point,

39
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,420
 and then we can run an LP,

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,670
 and we maximize z,

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,845
 and we see whether there's a solution with z as non-negative.

42
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:56,660
 So, we just consider one constraint,

43
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,890
 let's consider all n constraints.

44
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,375
 So, we look at the new LP which has the constraints Ax plus z is at most b,

45
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,335
 and x is non-negative,

46
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,505
 but z is unrestricted.

47
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:10,034
 Since z is unrestricted,

48
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:12,980
 it's trivial to always find a feasible point.

49
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,820
 We simply set z to be a small enough number.

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,100
 Now, our goal is to figure out whether there is a solution whereas z is non-negative.

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,710
 So, we add in the objective function maximize z.

52
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,320
 This new LP is always feasible,

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,250
 and we can run this LP and check whether the optimal value of z is non-negative.

54
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,672
 If the optimal value is non-negative, then that point,

55
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,850
 those Xs, if we ignore z,

56
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,460
 give us a feasible point to the original LP.

57
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,925
 And if this LP is optimized when z is negative,

58
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,810
 then we know that the original LP is infeasible.

59
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,960
 So, this gives us a way to check whether an LP is feasible or not,

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,700
 and it also gives us this feasible point for this LP if it is feasible.

61
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:55,700
 So, that'll give us a starting point for the simplex algorithm.
