Assuming every composite number has at least one non-trivial Fermat witness, it follows that at least half of the numbers 1 through r-1 are witnesses, suggesting that r is composite if for any number z from this set, z^(r-1) is not congruent to 1 mod r. This fact can be exploited to devise a primality test, which ignores Carmichael numbers, based on Fermat's little theorem. If z^(r-1) is congruent to 1 mod r for any chosen z from the set, then r may be prime; if not, r is definitely composite.
