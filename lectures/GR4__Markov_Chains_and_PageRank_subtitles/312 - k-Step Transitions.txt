Now if we look at this entry (i,j) , in this matrix P, this transition matrix P, corresponding to the way to the adjacency matrix. This tells me the probability of making the transition from I to J in one step. So if I'm in state I at time T, then PIJ is the probability that I'm in State J at time T plus one. Now what we just saw is that if we look at the square of the transition matrix, so P squared, then the entry (i,j) tells me the probability of going from state I to state J in two steps. And in general for any non-negative integer K, P to the K. So the Kth power of this transition matrix P. This tells me the probability of making a transition in exactly K steps.
