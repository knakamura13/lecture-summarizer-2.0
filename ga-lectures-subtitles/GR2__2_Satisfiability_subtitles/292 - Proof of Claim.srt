1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,675
 Now let's prove this claim that,

2
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:05,145
 if there is a path from alpha to beta then there's

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:08,240
 a path from beta bar to alpha bar, and vice versa.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,550
 So let's take a path from alpha to beta and let's

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,830
 construct a path from beta bar to alpha bar.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,750
 Let's give some notation for the vertices along this path from alpha to beta.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,600
 So let's say this path from alpha to beta goes along

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,565
 gamma0 to gamma1 and so on up to gammal.

9
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:25,695
 So it starts at alpha,

10
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:29,055
 so gamma0 is alpha and gammal is beta.

11
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,705
 Now let's take one of these edges.

12
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,390
 Let's look at the edge from gamma1 to gamma2.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,610
 How do we get an edge from gamma1 to gamma2?

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,515
 Well this edge from gamma1 to gamma2 comes from this clause,

15
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:41,995
 gamma1 bar or gamma 2.

16
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:45,165
 Now every clause has two edges which it implies.

17
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:47,405
 This is one of the edges. What's the other edge?

18
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:53,720
 The other edge we get, the other implication is gamma2 bar implies gamma1 bar.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,755
 Similarly, if we look at this edge gamma0 to gamma1,

20
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:02,325
 we're going to see that there's also an edge from gamma1 bar to gamma0 bar.

21
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,460
 And if we look along this part of the path,

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,760
 we're going to see that we get a path from gammal bar all the way over to gamma0 bar.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,070
 What is gammal bar?

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,060
 This is beta bar. And what is gamma0 bar? It's alpha bar.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,730
 So what we've shown is that if there is a path from alpha to beta,

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,660
 then there must be a path from beta bar to alpha bar,

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,070
 and that's what we wanted to prove.

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,530
 We wanted to prove that if there is a path from alpha to beta,

29
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,823
 then we can show that there is a path from beta bar to alpha bar.

30
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:33,035
 And then we can apply the same argument in reverse,

31
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,980
 and we can show that if there is a path from beta bar to alpha bar,

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,050
 and there's a path from alpha to beta.

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,155
 That proves the claim,

34
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:41,980
 and that completes the proof of correctness of our algorithm.

35
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:41,980
 So we've completed the argument for the linear time algorithm for two set.
