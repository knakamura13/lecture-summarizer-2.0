1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 Now, here again is Ford-Fulkerson algorithm,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,630
 and now the question is,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,315
 what is the time needed for one round of the algorithm?

4
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:10,570
 Now, one round of the algorithm are steps two through five.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,725
 In particular, we first build the residual network,

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:15,360
 then we check for a path,

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,520
 and then we augment along that path.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,955
 Now, originally, the residual network is just the input network.

9
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,775
 Now, given the residual network from the previous round

10
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,955
 how long does it take us to update the residual network?

11
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:30,715
 Given this augmentation along this path P

12
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:35,025
 while the residual network is simply going to change along this one path P,

13
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:39,360
 it might change along the forward edges or the backward edges, or both.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,185
 Now, this path is of length at most N and minus one edges,

15
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:47,375
 so it's going to take us order N time to update the residual network.

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:51,030
 How do we check for st-path in this residual network?

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,585
 Well, we run either DFS or BFS.

18
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,890
 The running time is linear,

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,855
 order N plus M. N is the number of vertices, M is the number of edges.

20
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,660
 Lets assume the number of edges is at least N minus one,

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,840
 then this is bounded by order M and also

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,795
 augmenting the flow along this path also takes order N time.

23
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:13,830
 So, one round of the algorithm is dominated by

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,485
 this checking for an st-path which takes order N time.

25
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:20,220
 Now, going back to our running time analysis what we

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,095
 concluded was that it takes order N time per round of the algorithm.

27
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:29,505
 As discussed before is most capital C rounds of the algorithm.

28
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:33,810
 Since in every round the flow increases by at least one unit, therefore,

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:33,810
 we can conclude that Ford Focus in algorithm requires time order N times capital C.
