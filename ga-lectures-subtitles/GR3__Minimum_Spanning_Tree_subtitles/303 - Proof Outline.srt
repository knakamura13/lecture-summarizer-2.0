1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 Now let's outline the proof of the code property.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,260
 Let's first fix a graph G,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,470
 here's our running example of a graph.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,500
 Let's fix the subset of edges x which are past solutions so far.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,105
 These are the green edges here.

6
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,890
 Our assumption is that x is a subset of T,

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,510
 where T is an MST.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,800
 Let's mark this tree T by the red edges.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,175
 Now we don't know these red edges,

10
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:24,090
 we don't know this MSTT but we know there exists

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,170
 such a tree T. So even though our algorithm doesn't know this tree T,

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,230
 we can use it in the proof because we are assuming

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,965
 the existence of this tree T. Now in addition to this tree T,

14
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:40,010
 I want to fix the subset of vertices which form the cut which no edge of x crosses.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,780
 So I want to fix this subset S. In this example,

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,305
 this is x and this is s bar.

17
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,535
 Now our assumption was that none of the green edges,

18
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:50,800
 none of the edges of x cross between s and s bar.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,860
 Now here are the green edges once again.

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,505
 And notice none of these green edges cross between s and s bar.

21
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:59,425
 Now there are edges of T which cross between s and s bar.

22
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:02,970
 Now that has to happen because T as an MST, is connected.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,505
 So it has to connect s to s bar. But we're just asking that

24
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,610
 no edge of the partial solution crosses between s and s bar.

25
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,775
 So no edge of x crosses s to s bar.

26
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:17,550
 No edge of x is part of the cut between s and s bar.

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,910
 Now we're going to take a particular edge e star which crosses this cut.

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,620
 Which edge are we allowed to choose?

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,560
 We're allowed to choose any edge of minimum weight across this cut.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,580
 So there are four other edges crossing this cut,

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,410
 and our assumption is that the weight of

32
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,340
 e star is at most the weight of any of these other edges.

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,435
 Now they may be equal,

34
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:42,150
 but no other edge crossing this cut has strictly smaller weight than e star.

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,490
 Now finally, what's our goal in this proof?

36
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,995
 Our goal is to construct a tree T prime,

37
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:50,505
 where T prime is a minimal spanning tree and

38
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:54,745
 where x union e star are all part of T prime.

39
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,180
 So x union e star are a subset of T prime.

40
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,940
 Now how can we possibly construct this T prime?

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,890
 Well we have this tree T. T is an M S T and T contains the partial solution x.

42
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,475
 Now the problem is that this tree T might not contain this edge e star.

43
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:19,745
 For example, in this case e star is not in one of the red edges. So what do we do?

44
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:23,990
 Well we try to modify this tree T to construct a new tree,

45
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,555
 T prime, and we'll show that this new tree T prime is a minimal spanning tree.

46
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,305
 So the weight of T prime is at most the weight of T,

47
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:33,090
 actually the weights must be equal,

48
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,830
 and this new tree T prime is modified a little bit from T so

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,830
 that it contains e star in addition to containing the partial solution x.
