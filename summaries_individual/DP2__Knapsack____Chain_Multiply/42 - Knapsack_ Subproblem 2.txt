Revised the subproblem definition for a max value optimization using subset of i objects, addressing earlier issue where solution for Ki-1 was insufficient. Realized we need optimal solutions for (i-1) with weight limit (B-weight of ith object). Strategy involves a 2D table with parameters i (0 to n) and b (0 to B), defining KIB as the max value with subset of objects 1 through i, with weight â‰¤ b. The target is to find KNB, the max value for all n objects within weight B, at the table's bottom right corner, solving the original problem.
