1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,985
 We're looking at this random variable W sub J,

2
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:05,910
 which takes value 1 or 0 depending on whether

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,495
 the clause Cj is satisfied or not by the random assignment.

4
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:12,259
 We want to analyze the expectation of W sub J.

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,170
 So we take the two possible values weighted by the probability of achieving that value.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,680
 So, we have value 1 times the probability that

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,631
 Wj equals 1 plus 0 times the probability Wj equals zero.

8
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:29,660
 That clearly, this term goes away and we're left with the probability Wj equals 1.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,015
 This is the beauty of considering a random variable which takes value 0 or 1.

10
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:39,625
 The expectation is simply the probability that that random variable equals value 1.

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,955
 Now, considering a sample of clause Cj, suppose this x1,

12
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:46,635
 or x2 bar, or x3 bar,

13
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:49,985
 or x4 and so on up to xK.

14
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:52,650
 So the clause has size K. Now,

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,474
 in order to achieve value 1,

16
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,885
 the clause has to be satisfied.

17
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,280
 Let's look at the compliment.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,320
 What's the probability the clause is not satisfied?

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,435
 Now, in order to not satisfy this clause,

20
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,205
 we have to set x1 to false,

21
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:09,145
 x2 to true, x3 to true and so on.

22
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:13,440
 That's exactly one setting of these variables,

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,095
 these K variables, so that this clause is not satisfied.

24
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:19,355
 The chance x1 is set to false is one-half.

25
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:26,655
 The chance that x1 is set to false and x2 is set to true and x3 is set to true and so on,

26
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:31,650
 so these K variables are set exactly to this one assignment.

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,635
 The probability of that one assignment is 2 to the minus

28
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:38,375
 K. That's the probability that this clause is not satisfied.

29
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,785
 What's the probability that is satisfied is a compliment of that,

30
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,460
 so it's 1 minus that.

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,830
 The probability that Wj equals 1 is equal to 1 minus 2 to the minus K. Now,

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,407
 notice something interesting, this gets better as K grows.

33
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:55,191
 The worst case is when K equals 1,

34
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,570
 it's a unit clause.

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,170
 So, suppose it's just x1,

36
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,090
 then what's the probability this clause does not satisfy

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,515
 is one-half and the probability it is satisfied is one-half.

38
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:04,515
 So, this quantity is always at least one-half. Since K is
