When developing a recurrence relation for prefixes with different ending characters, we examine a modification when these characters are identical (both end in 'A'). With X_i = Y_j, there are three options: omit X_i (and Y_j since they match), or conclude the optimal sequence with the shared character. For the first two options, the subproblem solution lengths are L(i,j) = L(i-1,j) or L(i,j-1) respectively. The unique third option, possible only when characters match, calculates L(i,j) = 1 + L(i-1,j-1), appending the common character to the optimal solution of the subproblem, determining the length of the longest common subsequence for the new problem.
