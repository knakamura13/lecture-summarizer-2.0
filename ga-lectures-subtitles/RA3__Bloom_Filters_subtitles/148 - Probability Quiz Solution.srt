1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
 Now, the solution is one_over_n_to_the_log_n.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,105
 Why is that? Let's look at it more closely.

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,160
 Take a particular ball j.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,231
 What is the probability that this ball is assigned to this particular bin Bi?

5
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:16,040
 Well, the ball is going to a randomly chosen bin,

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,245
 so the chance of going to any particular bin is one_over_n.

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:23,875
 Therefore, the first ball has probability one_over_n of being assigned to bin Bi.

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,297
 The second ball, same,

9
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:29,596
 has a probability one_over_n of being assigned to bin Bi,

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,240
 and so on for all these log_n balls.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,770
 So the probability that all of them are assigned to bin Bi

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,490
 is the product of one_over_n, for each.

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:39,490
 So, the total probability is one_over_n raised to the power log.
