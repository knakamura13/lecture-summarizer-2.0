00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,275
 Let's look an example instance for the halting problem.

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:06,560
 Let's look at the following simple program P. And I'll attempt to

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,220
 write it in C. My program P consists of one input variable,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,430
 X, and it consists of one while loop.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,390
 The while loop checks whether X mod two is equal to one.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,770
 So it checks whether X is odd.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,240
 If X is odd,

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,210
 then it adds six to X and it repeats.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,000
 And it keeps going until X is even.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,015
 Now let's look at this program P on input X equals five.

11
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,220
 Now for this simple program,

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,230
 it's easy to see what will happen.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,795
 X starts at five, and then it'll be 11,

14
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,930
 and then 17, 23, and so on.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,750
 X will always be odd.

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,780
 So the program never halts.

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,865
 This is going to be an infinite loop.

18
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,020
 Now of course, this is assuming infinite memory.

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,660
 So there's no overflows or anything like that.

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,510
 Therefore if we look at halting with this pair of inputs,

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,580
 program P and this input X equals five.

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,125
 Therefore, if I look at halting on this particular pair of inputs,

23
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,485
 program P and input X equals five,

24
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:08,240
 then this program has an infinite loop on this particular input.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,555
 Therefore, halting of P, five is false.

26
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:11,555
 Because the program P never terminates on this particular input, five.
