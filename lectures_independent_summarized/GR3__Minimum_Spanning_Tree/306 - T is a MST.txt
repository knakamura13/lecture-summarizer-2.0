Subgraph T' derived from tree T by adding edge e* and removing edge e'. T' is confirmed as a tree. Goal: prove T' is a MST. Since T is known MST with min weight, T' must match T weight to be MST. e* weight is least across cut and e' also crosses cut; hence, e* weight ≤ e' weight. Weight of T' is T weight + e* weight - e' weight. With e* ≤ e', T' weight ≤ T weight, which is minimum. Thus, T' must be MST and e* weight = e' weight; otherwise, T wouldn't be MST. Proves the cut property: for any cut, all edges crossing cut in tree must have equal weight for tree to be MST. Proof emphasizes two concepts: 1) adding e* to T forms cycle, removing any cycle edge yields new tree T'; 2) min-weight edge across a cut belongs to some MST, per cut property statement.
