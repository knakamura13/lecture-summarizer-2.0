1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,010
 Now we're going to talk about the Page Rank algorithm.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,000
 This is the algorithm invented by Brin and Page.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,385
 It was published in 1998.

4
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:11,215
 We're going to start by forgetting about Markov chains.

5
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:12,700
 You can understand the basic idea of

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,575
 the page rank algorithm without even knowing what a Markov chain is.

7
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:21,185
 Page Rank is a natural simple algorithm for determining the importance of web pages.

8
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,215
 Now importance is a subjective term

9
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:26,350
 and it's something that we're going to have to quantify ourselves.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,860
 Now part of the appeal of Page Rank is how they define

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,335
 importance has an interesting interpretation in terms of Markov chains.

12
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,045
 Now we're going to get to that at the end of the lecture,

13
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:39,970
 for now we'll forget about Markov chains and we'll just

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,915
 look at the simple idea for defining the Page Rank.

15
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,890
 To understand the appeal of Page Rank,

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,600
 let's go back and think about how search engines worked in the mid-90s.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,620
 Well the search engines would maintain a database of

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,120
 web pages and then given a query term Q, what would they do?

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,560
 They would do a grep for Q.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,680
 So they would search for all web pages containing that query term Q.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,245
 Now it's easy to spam or trick those search engines so that

22
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:10,060
 many of the common query terms are embedded in your web page.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,580
 That's another issue, let's ignore that for now.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,580
 The bigger issue is that you have many web pages that contain

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,890
 this query term and now how do you present it to the user?

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,585
 How do you sort the web pages?

27
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:24,710
 You want to put the most relevant web page up front so

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,917
 there are many web pages let's say containing this query term Q.

29
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,345
 How do you sort them?

30
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,260
 Well that's where the importance of the web page comes in.

31
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,130
 We're going to put the most important web pages

32
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,970
 containing this query term at the beginning of our list.

33
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,970
 For example, if you search for Markov chains and CNN lets say,

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,170
 happens to have an article about Markov chains,

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,550
 I'm not sure why that might be the case but let's just say,

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,665
 CNN has an article about Markov chains and I have on

37
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:53,300
 my web page I have several lecture notes about Markov chains.

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,440
 Now when we do this search,

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,330
 this grep, both web pages,

40
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,200
 mine and CNN are going to contain the query term for Markov chains.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,785
 Which one should be presented first?

42
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,500
 Well, presumably the user is more likely to be interested in

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,345
 the CNN article about Markov chains rather than my lecture notes about Markov chains.

44
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:09,345
 So let's dive into the algorithm description.
