Finding connected components in undirected graphs and topologically sorting Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) can be done with a single DFS run. For directed graphs, the equivalent concept is strongly connected components (SCCs). To find SCCs, we use an algorithm that requires just two runs of standard DFS. It is remarkable that identifying SCCs, which might seem more complex, can still be achieved with such a simple approach.
