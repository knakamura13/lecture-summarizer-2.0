Modular arithmetic example using mod three yields three possible values: 0, 1, or 2, forming three equivalence classes. Multiples of three modulo three equal zero. Numbers one more than multiples of three modulo three equal one, and numbers two more than multiples of three modulo three equal two. This applies to both positive and negative numbers; the rule for negative numbers is illustrated by separating the negative number into a multiple of three (Q) and a remainder (R), resulting in the same equivalence classes. For example, -3, 0, and 9 are congruent mod three, as are -2, 1, 4 mod three, and so forth, demonstrating that values remain consistent within their respective equivalence classes whether they are negative or positive.
