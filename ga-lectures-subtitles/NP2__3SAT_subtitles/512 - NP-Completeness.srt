1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430
 Our plan now is to prove that the 3SAT problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,891
 What we just saw is that if we have a problem such as SAT,

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,905
 which is known to be NP-complete,

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:11,230
 then this makes our task much easier.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,150
 So, we're going to use the fact that SAT is NP-complete.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,200
 This is known as a Cook-Levin-Theorem.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,385
 It was proved independently in 1971 by Steven Cook and Leonid Levin.

8
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:24,155
 And they proved that SAT is NP-complete.

9
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:25,669
 Now, we're going to take this theorem for granted.

10
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:27,985
 And later, I'll give you some high-level idea

11
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:31,065
 of the proof that the SAT problem is NP-complete.

12
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,245
 Now, after Steven Cook published his paper,

13
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:38,830
 then the importance of NP-completeness was highlighted by a paper by Dick Karp in 1972.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,655
 He showed 21 other problems which were NP-complete.

15
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:44,975
 We're going to look at a few of these 21 in the next few lectures.

16
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:44,975
 We'll start with 3SAT, which was one of the 21
