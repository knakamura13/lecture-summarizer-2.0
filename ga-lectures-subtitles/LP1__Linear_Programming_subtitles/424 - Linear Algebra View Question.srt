1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
 Now the variables are specified by this column vector x.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,125
 The objective function is specified by these coefficients,

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,509
 this column vector c, and hence

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,814
 our objective function is to maximize c_transpose times x.

5
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,079
 Then we have our constraint matrix.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,030
 This is an m by n matrix A.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,765
 Finally we have the constraints for the right hand side.

8
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:25,964
 This is specified by this column vector, b1 through bm.

9
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:31,394
 There're m constraints, so this vector has size m. Going back to our Lp formulation,

10
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,744
 we have our objective function.

11
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:36,329
 This is subject to the following constraints.

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,274
 We want those x where A times x is at most b,

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,909
 and we have the non-negativity constraint, x is non-negative.

14
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,314
 Now the last constraint is important, the non-activity constraint,

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,380
 because if the feasible region is non-empty,

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,354
 so there are some feasible x,

17
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:57,094
 then we know that the zero vector is a feasible point.

18
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:02,505
 So we can trivially find a feasible point or determine that the feasible region is empty,

19
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:02,505
 and therefore this Lp is infeasible.
