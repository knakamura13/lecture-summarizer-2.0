1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,297
 Now we can state the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

2
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:05,563
 This is going to follow the same basic approach we did before,

3
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:09,165
 but instead of considering the graph of available capacities,

4
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:11,880
 we're instead going to consider the residual network.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,585
 We're going to start by initializing the flow to zero everywhere,

6
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:18,845
 then we build the residual network for the current flow.

7
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:23,135
 Initially, the residual network will be the same as the input flow network.

8
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:27,620
 Now we look for a path from s to t in this residual network.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,945
 How do we look for the path?

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,330
 Once again we use DFS or BFS.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,500
 If there is no such path the,

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,450
 n we stop the algorithm and we output the current flow as

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,155
 our output as the max flow for this graph.

14
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:41,817
 If instead we found such a path,

15
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,483
 let's first denote this path by cal P,

16
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,845
 now given this path cal P,

17
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,400
 let's define the capacity of this path.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,770
 This is the minimum capacity along this path in the residual network.

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,770
 So look at the edges in this path,

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,495
 look at the capacities of these edges in the residual network.

21
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:05,655
 Finally, we augment the current flow by c(P) units along this path.

22
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:07,900
 What exactly does it mean to augment the flow?

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,655
 Well, for every forward edge we increase the flow along that edge by this amount.

24
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,390
 For every backward edge,

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,065
 we decrease the flow in the other direction,

26
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:21,925
 in the reverse direction by this amount.

27
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,525
 Finally, we'll repeat from step 2,

28
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:27,560
 build the residual network and check for an st-path

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,105
 and we continue repeating until there is no such st-path.

30
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:32,105
 And then we output the current flow as our solution to the max flow problem.
