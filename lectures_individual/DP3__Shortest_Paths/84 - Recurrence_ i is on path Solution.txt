Now, to write a recurrence for D of i, s, t, we want to use D of i minus one for some pair s and t, which might be different vertices. But the key thing is that we want to change this parameter i to i minus one. So how do we get that? Look at this path. This is a path from s to i which only uses a subset of the first i minus one vertices as intermediate vertices. So, that is D of i minus one s, i. That's a smaller subproblem which we've already solved in our dynamic programming algorithm. Similarly, this portion of the path is the shortest path from i to t which uses a subset of the first i minus one vertices as intermediate vertices. This is D of i minus one because the first i minus one vertices only are intermediate vertices on the path and it's starting at i and it's ending at t. So the total length of this path is the sum of these two terms. So now we have a recurrence with D of i, s, t. It's D of i minus one, s, i that gives us the shortest path from s to i using a subset of the first i minus one as intermediate vertices plus D of i minus one, i, t that gives us the path from i to t using this subset of one through i minus one as intermediate vertices on the path. So we have a recurrence for D of i, s, t in the case when i is in the path and we have the recurrence for the case when i is not in the path. What do we do? We take the best of those two sce-
