To show the reverse implication between satisfying assignments for C to the second prime and C to the second, consider the assignment that satisfies C to the second prime. Ignoring variable y, such an assignment also satisfies C to the second in all cases. If y is true, either x1 or x4 is false, satisfying C to the second. If y is false, either x2 must be false or x3 must be true to satisfy C to the second prime, thus also satisfying C to the second. Therefore, every satisfying assignment for C to the second prime corresponds to a satisfying assignment for C to the second, confirming the reverse implication and establishing the if and only if relationship.
