Goal: Compute A x B x C x D efficiently. Matrix multiplication is associative, allowing multiple computation sequences. Standard method: (A x B) x C x D. Alternatives: (A x B) x (C x D), (A x (B x C)) x D, ((C x D) x B) x A. Need to determine the best sequence â€“ the optimal parenthesization and its cost. Assigning costs to each operation will help identify the most efficient method for matrix multiplication.
