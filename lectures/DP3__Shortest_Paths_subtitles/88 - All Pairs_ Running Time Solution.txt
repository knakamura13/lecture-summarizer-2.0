Now, the running time of this algorithm is fairly straightforward to analyze because there's just nested for loops. And then, within the for loops, it's just order one time. Order one time. For the base cases, we have two nested for loops, each of size order n. So, the total time to fill in the base cases is order n-squared time. For the general case, we have three nested for loops, each of size order n, so the total time is order n-cubed. Order n-cubed dominates, so total run time is order n-cubed.
