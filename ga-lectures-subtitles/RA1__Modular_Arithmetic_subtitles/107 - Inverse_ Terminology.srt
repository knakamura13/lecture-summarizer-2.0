00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
 Suppose that X has an inverse mod N. So,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,660
 X inverse mod N exists.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,650
 Let's prove that this inverse,

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,085
 if it exists, is unique.

5
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:11,970
 What exactly do we mean by unique?

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,340
 Well, let's consider a specific example.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,470
 Here's a simple example.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,600
 X equals three and N equals 11.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,250
 What's the inverse of three mod 11?

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,550
 Well, these numbers are quite small,

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,200
 so it's easy to figure out that the inverse of three mod 11 is four,

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,270
 because three times four is 12,

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,275
 which is one mod 11.

14
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,515
 Now, if we look at four mod 11,

15
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:37,290
 there are an infinite number of equivalent numbers.

16
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,410
 For example, 15, 26,

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,425
 and so on, these are all congruent to four mod 11.

18
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:45,985
 We can also look at negative numbers,

19
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:48,815
 negative seven is congruent to four mod 11.

20
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:53,325
 And there are an infinite number of such numbers which are equivalent to four mod 11.

21
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:58,560
 All of these numbers are inverses of X mod N, but for concreteness,

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,295
 we'll always report the inverse of X mod N as the smallest non-negative integer.

23
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:08,490
 So, we report it as the integer between zero and N minus one,

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,210
 if that inverse of X mod N exists.

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,345
 And if the inverse of X mod N does not exist,

26
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:18,050
 we simply report does not exist.

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,515
 Now, later in this lecture,

28
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:23,065
 you'll see how to find the multiplicative inverse if it exists.

29
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,460
 And to do that, we'll use the extended Euclid algorithm.

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,930
 In that case, often,

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,930
 the algorithm will return the negative number and then

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,140
 we'll have to do a simple calculation in order to convert it to a number,

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,140
 an integer between zero and N minus one.
