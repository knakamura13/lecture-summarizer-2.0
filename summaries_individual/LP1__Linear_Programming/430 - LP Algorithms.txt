Ellipsoid algorithm and interior point methods solve linear programs in polynomial time, with ellipsoid having more theoretical interest and interior point methods being extensively used. Simplex algorithm, though potentially exponential in the worst case, is widely adopted for its efficiency and guaranteed optimal solutions upon completion, especially for large LPs. Will explore simplex algorithm's high-level concept.
