Now the variables are specified by this column vector x. The objective function is specified by these coefficients, this column vector c, and hence our objective function is to maximize c_transpose times x. Then we have our constraint matrix. This is an m by n matrix A. Finally we have the constraints for the right hand side. This is specified by this column vector, b1 through bm. There're m constraints, so this vector has size m. Going back to our Lp formulation, we have our objective function. This is subject to the following constraints. We want those x where A times x is at most b, and we have the non-negativity constraint, x is non-negative. Now the last constraint is important, the non-activity constraint, because if the feasible region is non-empty, so there are some feasible x, then we know that the zero vector is a feasible point. So we can trivially find a feasible point or determine that the feasible region is empty, and therefore this Lp is infeasible.
