To determine if an LP's feasible region is empty, introduced variable z with x vector of size n. Adding z to the constraint equation on the LHS, while x's remain non-negative but z unrestricted (can be pos/neg), results in an equation that is always solvable by setting z to a sufficiently negative number. Need to establish if the revised equation solves with z being non-negative. Form new LP with objective to maximize z, where Ax + z ≤ b, x ≥ 0, z unrestricted. New LP is inherently feasible because z can be set large enough in the negative direction. Running this LP will show if a non-negative optimal z exists, demonstrating feasibility of original LP by ignoring z, providing a starting point for simplex algorithm. Conversely, if LP optimizes with z negative, the original LP is infeasible.
