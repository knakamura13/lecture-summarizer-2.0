00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,275
 Before we dive into the proof of the Lemma,

2
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:06,030
 let's take a quick quiz on some basic properties of roots of unity.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,460
 We saw just before about Omega_n to the negative one,

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,330
 the inverse of Omega_n.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,430
 To make sure you understand that let's look at Omega_n square.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,325
 What's the inverse of this number?

7
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,290
 And don't simply write it with negative two in the exponent,

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,290
 write in some manner so that you have a positive exponent.
