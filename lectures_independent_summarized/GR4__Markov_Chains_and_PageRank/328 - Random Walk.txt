Examining web graph G, it's clear that vertices represent web pages and directed edges signify hyperlinks. A random walk on G models web surfing: starting from a page X, randomly following hyperlinks to traverse the graph. The process defines a Markov chain with a transition matrix reflecting the probability of moving from one webpage to another. For a given page Y with a hyperlink to X, the transition probability to X is the reciprocal of Y's total hyperlinks. If there's no link from Y to X, the matrix entry is zero. This setup creates a Markov chain with an identifiable stationary distribution, which represents the likelihood of being on any particular web page in the long run.
