Now let's look at the reverse implication. In this case we're going to take a satisfying assignment for C to the second prime and we're going to construct a satisfying assignment for C to the second. What we're going to show is that if we just ignore y, whatever the assignment was for x to the first, x to the second, x to the third, and x to the fourth which satisfied C to the second prime, that's going to satisfy C to the second. Now there will be two cases, either y is true or y is false. Suppose y is true. We know that C to the second prime is satisfied, so each of these two clauses is satisfied. y is true so that satisfies this clause. How about the second clause? Well, either x to the first must be false or x to the fourth must be false. Well, if x to the first is false or x to the fourth is false, both of these satisfy C to the second. So in either of these scenarios, we have an assignment which satisfies C to the second. Now suppose y is false. So this assignment for y satisfies this second clause. How do we satisfy this first clause? What we're assuming that this is a satisfying assignment for C to the second prime so it must satisfy this first clause. y is false, so that's not helping. So it must be the case that either x to the second is false or x to the third is true. So either x to the second is false or x to the third is true. Now if x to the second is false, that means that this is an assignment which satisfies C to the second and if x to the third is true, then also this is an assignment which satisfies C to the second. So in any of these four cases, we have an assignment which satisfies C to the second. So every satisfying assignment for C to the second prime if we ignore y, it's also a satisfying assignment for C to the second. And this establishes the reverse implication. We've done both directions, so we've shown the if and only if.
