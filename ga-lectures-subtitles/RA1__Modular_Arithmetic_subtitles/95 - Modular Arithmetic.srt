1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
 Now let's take a look at modular arithmetic.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,320
 This is the basic mathematics that underlies

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,685
 the RSA algorithm and we're going to see a lot of beautiful mathematics along the way.

4
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:09,975
 Let's look at a simple example,

5
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:13,345
 X modular two where X is an integer.

6
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:14,545
 What is X mod two?

7
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:17,145
 This is the least significant bit of X.

8
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,365
 What does the least significant bit of X tell you?

9
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:21,540
 It tells you whether X is odd or even.

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,695
 In particular, it's one if X is odd and zero if X is even.

11
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:29,655
 Now, what's another way of looking at this least significant bit of X?

12
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,680
 Well, we can take X divided by two.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,970
 If it's even then the remainder is going to be zero because it's a multiple of two,

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,570
 and if it's odd, then the remainder when X divided by two is going to be one.

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,810
 So we looked at X mod two.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,505
 Now let's look at X mod N where N is an arbitrary integer at least one.

17
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,815
 Recall X mod two is the remainder when we do X divided by two.

18
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:55,230
 So X mod N is going to be the remainder when we divide X by

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,210
 N. Finally let's look at some important notation for modular arithmetic.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,960
 Suppose we have two numbers X and Y,

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,255
 and we look at these two numbers modular N,

22
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:06,535
 and suppose that they're same mod N,

23
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:09,485
 how do we denote that? Well, they're not equal.

24
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,840
 The two numbers are not equal,

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,670
 but they're congruent in this,

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,715
 or they're equivalent in this world modular N.

27
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:19,415
 So how do we denote that equivalence or congruence?

28
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:22,685
 So the standard indication is three lines instead of two lines.

29
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:27,460
 So this notation means that X and Y are congruent modular N,

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,415
 which means that when we look at X divided by N,

31
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,290
 and Y divided by N,

32
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,565
 they have the same remainder,

33
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:35,815
 and we denote that by three lines,

34
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:35,815
 X is congruent to Y modular.
