Developed in the '50s by Bellman and Ford, the Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source in a weighted directed graph, handling negative edge weights. The algorithm initializes the distance to the source (S) as zero and iteratively relaxes edges to find the shortest paths, updating distances for a total of n-1 iterations, where n is the number of vertices. Each iteration inspects all edges and compares the current best-known distance with a new candidate path that includes the edge being relaxed; if the candidate is better, the best-known distance is updated. The algorithm can also identify negative weight cycles, as such cycles would continue to reduce the path length even after n-1 iterations. The overall time complexity is O(n*m), with n being the number of vertices and m the number of edges, which is less efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm but is needed to accommodate graphs with negative weight edges and to detect negative weight cycles. The algorithm involves reversing the graph for edge relaxation and requires linear time to construct the reversed graph, contributing to its computational cost.
