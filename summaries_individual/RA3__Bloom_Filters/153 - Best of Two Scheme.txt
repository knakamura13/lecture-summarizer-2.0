Revised the balls and bins problem to decrease max bin load. Previously, balls were assigned to bins randomly and independently â€” either in parallel or sequentially. Now, assign balls sequentially, choosing two bins randomly per ball and assigning to the one with the lesser load. This adjustment aims for a more balanced distribution of ball to bin assignments by choosing bins with the least load for each ball, potentially reducing the maximum load any single bin carries.
