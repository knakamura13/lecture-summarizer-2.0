FFT transforms coefficients a(x) into values A at nth root of unity via matrix M multiplication. Inverse FFT retrieves coefficients by multiplying values by inverse of M. Inverse matrix M is scaled by 1/n and uses nth roots of unity inverses, omega_n^(n-1), as elements. Omega_n inverse is computed by n-th power, yielding 1 (omega_n * omega_n^(n-1) = omega_n^n = 1). Understanding the inverse requires visualizing complex plane unit circle or using polar coordinates. Inverse FFT matrix simplification includes substituting omega_n inverses into matrix M, scaled by 1/n.
