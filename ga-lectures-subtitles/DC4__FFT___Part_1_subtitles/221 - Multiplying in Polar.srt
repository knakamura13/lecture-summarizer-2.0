1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
 As we mentioned earlier polar coordinates are convenient for multiplication.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,565
 Let's consider an example.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:10,785
 Consider Z1 and Z2, a pair of complex numbers and let's look at their product.

4
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:14,100
 Let's say that Z1 in polar coordinates is r1 theta

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,050
 1 and Z2 in polar coordinates is r2 theta 2.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,670
 Now let's look at the product of these polar coordinates.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,750
 We simply multiply the lengths and we add up the angles.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,790
 Now suppose that I have a point Z. I have

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,640
 a complex number Z and I want to look at its opposite.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,045
 So I want to look at negative Z so this corresponds to multiplying Z times negative 1.

11
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,920
 What is negative 1 in polar coordinates?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,680
 Here's the point negative 1 in the complex plane.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,945
 It's a distance one from the origin and it has angle 180 degrees or pi,

14
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,770
 so its polar coordinates are 1 comma pi.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,200
 And let's say Z is this point at polar coordinates r comma theta,

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,100
 then negative Z corresponds to the product of

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,640
 r comma theta times negative 1 in polar coordinates which is 1 comma pi.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,560
 Then using this above rule we have that negative Z

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,175
 is at the polar coordinates r comma theta plus pi.

20
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:11,630
 So the point negative C is the reflection of the point Z.

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,710
 It's just the same distance from the origin.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,570
 It's a distance r from the origin,

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,340
 and instead of going in angle theta we go in angle theta plus pi.

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,510
 So if you view the complex numbers in the complex plane,

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,510
 it's easy to find their opposites by looking at their reflection.
