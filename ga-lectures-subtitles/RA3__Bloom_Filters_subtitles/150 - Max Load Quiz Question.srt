00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
 Now what we saw in the last slide was that the probability that

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,310
 a particular bin Bi gets load at least log n is at most, one_over_n_squared.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,655
 Now, can we use that to bound the max load?

4
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:15,935
 Can we upper bound the probability that the max load is at least log n?

5
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:18,460
 Why don't you go ahead and write this quantity here.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,560
 If you have trouble doing it,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:19,560
 don't worry, we'll go through it in a minute.
