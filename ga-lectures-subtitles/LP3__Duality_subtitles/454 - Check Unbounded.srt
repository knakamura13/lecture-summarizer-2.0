00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 Now let's go back to one of our questions from earlier.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,410
 Can we check whether an LP is unbounded?

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,555
 So consider an LP in canonical form,

4
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,710
 maximize C transpose X,

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,415
 AX is at most B,

6
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:13,140
 and X is non-negative.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,910
 Now, can we check whether this LP is infeasible or not? Well, we saw how to do that.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,540
 We make a new LP by adding another variable Z,

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,210
 and we maximize Z and we change the constraint to AX plus Z is at most B,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,395
 and we check whether there's a solution where Z is non-negative.

11
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:35,715
 If there is such a non-negative Z which satisfies this new LP,

12
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:39,970
 then that gives us a feasible point of the original LP.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,530
 So we saw how to do this,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,575
 and we saw how to obtain a feasible point of this LP, if it is feasible.

15
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:49,875
 Now, how do we check whether this LP is unbounded or not?

16
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:55,470
 Well, what do we know? We know if it's unbounded then the dual LP will be infeasible.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,170
 So we could simply check the dual LP and check whether it's feasible or not.

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,090
 Well, if we simply check the dual LP and we see it's infeasible,

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,950
 then what do we know about the primal?

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,885
 Well, if the dual LP is infeasible,

21
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:12,135
 then the primal is either unbounded or infeasible.

22
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:14,010
 We don't know which of these two is the case because

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,750
 the weak duality theorem just tells us that if the primal is unbounded,

24
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,585
 then the dual is infeasible.

25
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,060
 But it's non-equivalence.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,070
 So how do we check whether this original LP is unbounded or not?

27
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,375
 Well, first we check whether it's feasible or not,

28
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,780
 whether there is a feasible point for this primal LP.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,545
 Assuming there is at least one feasible point so the feasible region is non-empty.

30
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,530
 So it is not infeasible.

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,895
 And then we check whether the dual LP is infeasible.

32
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:44,070
 So now we know that the primal is not infeasible.

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,610
 So it's true to this case.

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,850
 So now if the dual LP is infeasible,

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,780
 then we know the primal is unbounded.

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,665
 So we simply have two feasibility questions.

37
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:55,465
 We check whether the primal is feasible or not.

38
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:55,465
 And then we check whether the dual is infeasible or not.
