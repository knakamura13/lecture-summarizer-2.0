1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
 So for a new sub problem definition,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,930
 we define the recurrence for the case when

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,960
 the last characters of the two prefixes are different.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,700
 Now, let's go look at the case where

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,900
 the last characters of the two prefixes are the same.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,075
 So i have modified the example so that this is the case.

7
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:17,125
 Here, they both end in A.

8
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:20,175
 We're looking now at a case where X_i equals Y_j,

9
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:23,210
 So the last characters of the two prefixes are the same.

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,265
 And now, in this case,

11
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:26,450
 there are three possibilities to consider.

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,840
 As in the unequal case,

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,050
 we can either not include X_i in the optimal solution,

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,065
 in which case we drop X_i or we drop Y_j.

15
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:40,440
 Notice actually those two are the same in this scenario because X_i and Y_j are the same.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,245
 So we're dropping X_i we're also dropping Y_j.

17
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:47,100
 I'm just going to foreshadow a little bit of the solution or recurrence.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,030
 The other possibility which didn't exist in the unequal case is that

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,860
 the optimal solution ends in the common character X_i equals Y_j.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,715
 As in the unequal case,

21
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,220
 what we're going to do is we're going to look at

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,255
 these three scenarios and we're going to take the best of the three.

23
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:06,532
 Now, in the first case, where we drop X_i noticed that L of i,

24
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:10,648
 j is equal to L of i minus one j,

25
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:13,290
 where we just dropped X_i from the solution,

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,424
 just like in the unequal case.

27
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:19,080
 Similarly, when we drop Y_j,

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,260
 L of i, j equals L_i, j minus one.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,720
 Now, the interesting case which didn't exist before in

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,930
 the unequal case is that the optimal solution ends in this common character.

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,425
 And in this case, L of i, j is one plus,

32
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:40,260
 the one is for the common character that were pending on the end and then,

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,610
 we're going to take the optimal solution which drops X_i and

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,670
 Y_j from there and we take the optimal solution to these smaller prefixes.

35
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,265
 So this is L of i minus one and j minus one.

36
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:59,360
 We take the length of that optimal solution for that smaller problem,

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,060
 add one for this common character which we append at the end and that gives us

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,060
 the length of the longest common sub sequence in this new sub problem.
