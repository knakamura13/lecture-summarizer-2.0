1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,005
 Given this polynomial A of X,

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:03,810
 we would define this pair of polynomials,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,670
 A even and A odd.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,470
 They satisfy the following identity,

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,330
 A evaluated at the point x is equal to A even

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,880
 evaluated at the point x squared plus x times A odd evaluated at the point x squared.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,820
 Now let's suppose that the two endpoints that we want to evaluate

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,355
 A of X at satisfy the plus minus property.

9
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:28,170
 So the first end points are the opposite of the next end point.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,430
 So let's look at A evaluated at the point XI and A evaluated the point X N plus I.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,300
 Because of the plus minus property,

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,750
 this is A evaluated at XI and A evaluated at negative X I.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,380
 Plugging this into our earlier formula.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,600
 We have that A evaluated at the point XI is equal to A even evaluated at

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,020
 the point XI squared plus XI times A odd evaluated at the point XI squared.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,230
 And similarly for A evaluated to point negative XI,

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,025
 we have it's equal to A even again at the point XI squared minus XI times again,

18
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,270
 A odd at the point XI squared.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,390
 So notice to get A at these two different points,

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,700
 we need A even and A odd at the same points.

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,370
 Our conclusion is that if we're given A even and A odd at

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,130
 these endpoints Y1 through YN which are the square of these two endpoints.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,880
 Notice that since these two endpoints satisfy this plus minus property,

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,940
 the square of these two endpoints are these endpoints.

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,280
 Then in order N time,

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,255
 we get A evaluated at these two endpoints in particular to evaluate A at the point XI,

27
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:48,275
 it takes order one time given the value of A even at this point and A odd at this point.

28
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:53,190
 And similarly to evaluate A at the point XN plus I it takes order one

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,190
 time given the value of A even at this point and A odd at this point.
