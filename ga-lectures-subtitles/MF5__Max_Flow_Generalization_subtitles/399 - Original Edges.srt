1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,565
 Now the edges in the original flow network G,

2
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:05,322
 remain in this new flow network G prime.

3
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:08,715
 What will change is the capacities along these edges.

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,710
 Now we want the capacities along these edges to

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,025
 capture the capacities along the original network,

6
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,755
 and the demands in the original network.

7
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:20,370
 What we want to capture is that there is non-negative flow along an edge,

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,435
 if and only if we can construct a flow in the original network,

9
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:26,930
 where the flow is at least the demand.

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,570
 And we also want that the flow in this new graph G prime,

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,180
 satisfies this new capacity constraint,

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,595
 if and only if this flow f,

13
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,037
 that we're going to construct,

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,840
 satisfies the capacity constraint in the original network.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,360
 Now, the idea is that we want to flow zero in

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,030
 this new network to correspond to flow d in this original network.

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,295
 So this flow is going to be a shift of this flow by d units.

18
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:55,255
 So, were going to shift the capacity as well by d units.

19
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,210
 So the capacities along these edges,

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,415
 which were edges in the original network,

21
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:03,115
 will be the original capacities minus the demand.

22
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:07,485
 So, whereas this edge from s to a originally had capacity 10,

23
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,390
 now it'll have capacity seven.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,120
 This edge will have a capacity of one,

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,120
 four, four, and also four.
