1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 Finally state the structural Lemma known as the cut property.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,300
 This is a Lemma from which we'll derive the correctness of our MST algorithms.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,200
 So the Lemma considers an undirected graph G. So let's

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,810
 consider the graph that we've been having as a running example.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,480
 Now we're going to take a subset of edges.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,070
 I've marked a particular subset of edges in this graph by the green edges here.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,980
 Now we're going to assume that this subset of edges is part of

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,565
 an MST T. Now you should think of this set X as,

9
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,160
 you have an algorithm for the MST problem,

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,660
 and you have a partial solution that you're building up edge by edge.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,190
 X is your partial solution so far.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,930
 And you assume by induction that this partial solution is correct so far.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,760
 So to be correct so far,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,970
 that means that this subset X that you've constructed so far,

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,095
 is a subset of MST T. Now you don't know what T is.

16
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,420
 But you know that your solution is correct so far.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,480
 So it is a subset of some MST T So

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,925
 for this particular example I have the green edges, which are marked here.

19
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,905
 And these are what my algorithm has constructed so far.

20
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:03,555
 And we're assuming that our partial solution X,

21
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:06,660
 the green edges, are part of an MST T,

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,920
 which I marked by red edges here.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,885
 So the red edges are an MST T,

24
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:13,860
 and we don't know this MST.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,615
 But we have the green edges.

26
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:19,470
 And we just know by induction that the green edges are part of an MST.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,030
 So we have a partial solution,

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,675
 which is correct so far.

29
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:24,860
 And our algorithm is working edge by edge.

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,645
 So we're going to consider the next edge that we're going to add into X.

31
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:31,690
 And we want to prove correctness of this next edge being added into X.

32
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,525
 Now what are we going to assume about the edge that we're trying to add into X?

33
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,365
 We're going to assume that it crosses a cut of this graph.

34
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,440
 So in particular, we're going to take a subset S,

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,855
 and we're going to look at the cut between S and S bar.

36
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,605
 So here's a particular set S,

37
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,840
 and here's a compliment of S. Our assumption is that

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,605
 no edge of our partial solution so far X,

39
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:55,500
 crosses this cut S, S bar.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,510
 So notice that no green edge crosses between S and S bar.

41
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,205
 I notice there are many sets S, where this is true.

42
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:07,625
 But we get to choose any set S where no green edge crosses between S and S Bar.

43
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,620
 Now there are no green edges crossing between S and S Bar.

44
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,985
 But there is at least one edge of the graph G which crosses from S to S bar,

45
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,670
 because it's a connected graph.

46
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,990
 So we're going to look at all edges of the graph G,

47
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,750
 which cross the cut S S bar.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,730
 So I've marked in pink or purple,

49
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,440
 the five edges of the graph G,

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,814
 which cross between S and S bar.

51
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,850
 Now of these five edges,

52
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,815
 I want to take a minimum weight edge.

53
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:34,970
 So let E star be a minimum weight edge.

54
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,340
 Now there might be multiple edges of minimum weight.

55
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,715
 It doesn't matter. You get to choose which one you want.

56
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:43,295
 So let E star be any minimum weight edge across this cut.

57
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,165
 So let's mark this particular edge as E star.

58
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,930
 So we're assuming that these four other edges crossing the cut,

59
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,780
 have weight which is at least the weight of E star.

60
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,160
 Now finally what's our conclusion?

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,630
 Our conclusion is that we can add E star to our current MST construction,

62
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,330
 and we'll still be on our way to an MST.

63
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,292
 So if we look at our partial solution X,

64
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,955
 and we add E star to it.

65
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:05,860
 So we look at X unit E star.

66
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,010
 Then this is a subset of T prime,

67
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,775
 where T prime is an MST.

68
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:13,860
 So if our partial solution X was on its way to an MST T,

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,385
 we didn't know T, but we just knew that it was correct so far.

70
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:18,900
 Then if we add an edge,

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,330
 which is the minimum weight edge across the cut,

72
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,305
 and no edge of the partial solution crosses this cut so far.

73
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,735
 Then if we add this edge E star,

74
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:29,190
 to our partial solution,

75
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,180
 then we'll still be on our way to an MST T prime.

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,495
 Now this MST that we're going towards now,

77
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,860
 it might be different than the previous MST.

78
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,820
 But our goal is just to find a MST.

79
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,825
 We're not looking for a particular MST.

80
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,425
 So if we were on our way to an MST before,

81
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,065
 so our partial solution was correct so far,

82
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:46,065
 then we'll be on our way to an MST by adding this edge E star in.
