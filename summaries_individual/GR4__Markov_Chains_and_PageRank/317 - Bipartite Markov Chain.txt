Markov chain graph corresponding to a bipartite structure analyzed. Starting on the left (states 1, 3, 5) ensures odd-time presence on the right side, and vice versa for starting on the right (states 2, 4). Key outcome: starting state influences position at even/odd times, highlighting the importance of the starting state in bipartite graphs. To negate bipartiteness and ensure aperiodicity, introduce self-loops on vertices with a small probability (e.g., 0.01) to allow staying in the same state. Rescale other probabilities to maintain total probability of 1. Transition matrix should have positive diagonal entries indicating self-loops, thus eliminating any periodic structure and creating a non-bipartite, aperiodic Markov chain. Ensure all states have a positive probability for self-transition to avoid periodic pitfalls.
