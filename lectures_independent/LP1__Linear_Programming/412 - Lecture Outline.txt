In this section, we'll explore linear programming. This is a powerful technique. We'll see how to solve a variety of problems using linear programming. We'll start by seeing how we solve max flow using linear programming, then we'll see a few simple examples of linear programs for production problems. After looking at these examples, we'll give the general formulation of linear programming, and look at the standard form for LPs. Finally, we'll look at LP duality, which is a beautiful and important aspect of this topic. Let's dive in and look at how we express max flow as a linear program.
