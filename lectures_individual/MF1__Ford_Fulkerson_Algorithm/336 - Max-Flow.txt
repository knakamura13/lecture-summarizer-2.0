In this section, we'll look at the graph problem, known as the Max-flow problem. It's a quite useful problem. We'll first look at basic algorithm for the problem, known as a Ford Fulkerson Algorithm, and then we'll prove correctness of the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm. And along the way, we'll get the classic result known as the Max-flow- min-cut theorem. Next, we'll look at the nice application of the Max-flow problem to computer vision known as the Image Segmentation problem. We'll also look at a more general version of the problem, Max-flow with additional demand constraints, and we'll see how to reduce this more general problem to the original Max-flow problem. Finally, we'll see a faster Algorithm for the Max-flow problem, known as the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm.
