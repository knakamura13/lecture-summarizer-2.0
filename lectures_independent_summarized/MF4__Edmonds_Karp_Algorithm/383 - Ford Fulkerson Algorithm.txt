Ford-Fulkerson algorithm operates on a directed graph with integer edge capacities, denoted C_sub_e, to find a maximum flow from source, s, to sink, t. Initially, flows are set to zero. Algorithm constructs a residual network, G_superscript_f, then searches for an augmenting path using BFS or DFS from s to t. If no path exists, current flow is max size; if path exists, find minimum capacity, c(P), along path and augment flow by c(P). This process repeats, updating residual network and searching for paths until no augmenting path can be found, indicating termination of the algorithm and an optimal solution. Focus now shifts to Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
