Primality testing algorithm always correctly identifies a prime number r, as all z raised to r_minus_one modulo r equals one, according to Fermat's theorem. When r is composite and not a Carmichael number, the algorithm can still be correct if it finds a Fermat witness (where z raised to r_minus_one modulo r doesn’t equal one). However, the algorithm may falsely identify r as prime if it finds a z that's not a Fermat witness. Since at least half of z's are Fermat witnesses, the probability of a false positive—mistaking r for prime—is at most 1/2. Current aim is to enhance the algorithm to reduce this false positive rate.
