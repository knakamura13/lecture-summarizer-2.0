Exploring from a vertex Z for the first time in an undirected graph involves marking Z as visited, assigning it the current connected component count, and examining all its neighbors in the adjacency list. For each unvisited neighbor W, the Explore procedure recursively continues. Depth-First Search (DFS), a linear time algorithm, determines the runtime, specifically O(N + M), where N is the number of vertices and M is the number of edges. This process adequately identifies all connected components in an undirected graph. For directed graphs, additional information from the DFS is necessary to understand connectivity.
