Sorting an array of n nums using a chosen pivot, 11, into <p, =p, >p buckets. Scan array, assign nums to corresponding buckets. Dual occurrences of pivot noted. K's value determines the target list for Kth smallest num: if K â‰¤ the smallest list size, search only that list; if K=5 or 6, output pivot; if K > 6, search for (K-6)th smallest in >p list. Recursive search limited to one list, unlike QuickSort which sorts both <p and >p lists. Pseudocode forthcoming to illustrate the general case.
