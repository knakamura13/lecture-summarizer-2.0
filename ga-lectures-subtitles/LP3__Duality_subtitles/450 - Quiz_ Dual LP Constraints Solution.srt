1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 To define the Dual LP, we first have to convert

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,935
 the primal LP into canonical or standard form.

3
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:08,610
 This conversion is just for convenience.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,490
 It's easier to remember how to convert an LP in standard form into its Dual LP.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,220
 When we have an LP like this,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,345
 with these mixed inequalities,

7
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:21,730
 it's harder to remember how to convert into dual LP.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,525
 Now to convert this into canonical or standard form,

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,970
 we need to flip this inequality.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,165
 We flip it by multiplying both sides by negative one,

11
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:34,140
 and it becomes minus two times x_1,

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,672
 plus x_2, isn't most negative three.

13
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:38,855
 This is equivalent to the original constraint.

14
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:42,780
 To get the coefficients for the object function in a dual LP,

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,265
 we look at the right-hand side of the constrains in the primer LP.

16
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:50,670
 The right-hand sides are one, and negative three.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,340
 So this vector d is one, negative three.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,960
 And the objective function is minimizing Y_1,

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,095
 plus negative three times Y_2.

20
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:07,990
 This matrix E will be the transpose of the constraint matrix E over here.

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,690
 The first row in E will correspond to the column for x in the primal.

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,850
 The column for x is one, negative two.

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,375
 So the first row will be one, negative two.

24
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:24,405
 So the left-hand side of the first constraint is Y_1, minus 2Y_2.

25
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,875
 Second row is defined by x_2,

26
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,030
 which is one, one.

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,905
 So the left-hand side is Y_1, plus Y_2.

28
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,390
 The third row is defined by x_3,

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,795
 which is negative four, zero.

30
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:40,375
 So the left-hand side of the third constraint is negative 4_Y_1.

31
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,430
 For the right-hand side of the constraints in the dual LP,

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,310
 we look at the objective function in the primal LP.

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,150
 The coefficients are five, negative seven, two.

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,470
 So this vector f is five, negative seven, two.

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,095
 And the right- hand sides are five, negative seven, tow.

36
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,640
 So the first constraint is Y_1,

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,580
 minus 2Y_2 is at least five.

38
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,215
 The second constraint is Y_1,

39
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:04,870
 plus Y_2 is at least negative seven.

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,390
 The last constraint is negative 4Y_1 is at least two.

41
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:08,390
 And this defines a Dual LP.
