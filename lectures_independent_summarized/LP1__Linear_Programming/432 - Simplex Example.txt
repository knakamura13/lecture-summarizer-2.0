Utilized the simplex algorithm to maximize an objective function across a three-dimensional convex polyhedron. Starting from (0, 0, 0) with zero profit, iteratively moved to neighboring vertices with higher profit at each step: from zero profit at the origin to a profit of 300 at (300, 0, 0), then to 1500 at (300, 200, 0), increasing to 2000 at (300, 200, 50), and finally reaching the peak at 2400 with point (200, 200, 100). Each new vertex corresponded to satisfying a set of constraints with equality while maintaining the others with inequalities. After examining all neighboring points from the peak vertex and finding none better, concluded the current vertex as the optimal solution to the linear programming problem.
