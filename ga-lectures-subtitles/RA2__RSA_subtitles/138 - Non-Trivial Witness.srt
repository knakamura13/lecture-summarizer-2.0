1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 Now we call this Fermat witness that we just derived a trivial Fermat witness.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,315
 Why is it a trivial Fermat witness?

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,700
 This is a Fermat witness, z,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,500
 where it also has the property that

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,050
 the greatest common divisor of z and r is greater than 1.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,030
 So z and r are not relatively prime.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,005
 Notice, such as z already proves that r is composite.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:22,710
 If z and r have a non-trivial divisor,

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,350
 then we know that r has a non-trivial divisor,

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,700
 and therefore, it's not prime.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,550
 So, any z where this is the case,

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,840
 proves that r is composite,

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,850
 there's no reason to run Fermat's test.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,645
 So that's why we called such a z,

15
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:36,600
 a trivial Fermat witness.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,500
 Now there always exists a trivial Fermat witness for composite numbers.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,210
 Why? Because every composite number has at least two non-trivial divisors.

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,625
 The question is whether a composite number r,

19
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,985
 has a non-trivial Fermat witness.

20
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:53,760
 This is a number z which is relatively prime to r. Now it turns

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,780
 out that some composite numbers have no non-trivial Fermat witnesses,

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,505
 these are called pseudo primes,

23
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,055
 but those are relatively rare.

24
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,855
 For all the other composite numbers,

25
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,610
 they have at least one non-trivial Fermat witness,

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,110
 and if they have at least one,

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,585
 then in fact, they have many Fermat witnesses.

28
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:14,665
 And therefore it will be easy to find a Fermat witness and that's the key point.

29
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:17,530
 Trivial Fermat witnesses always exist.

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,975
 Every composite number has at least two trivial Fermat witnesses.

31
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:25,200
 But if a composite number has a non-trivial Fermat witness,

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,450
 then there are many Fermat witnesses,

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,025
 they're dense and therefore they're easy to find.

34
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:30,025
 And that's what we'll utilize for our primality testing algorithm.
