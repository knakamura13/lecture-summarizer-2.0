Analyzing the expectation of the binary random variable Wj, representing the satisfaction of clause Cj by a random assignment where Wj=1 if satisfied and Wj=0 if not. The expectation equals the probability that Wj=1. Considering a K-sized clause Cj comprising literals like x1, x2 bar, ..., xK, the probability of Cj not being satisfied is the product of probabilities for each literal setting, equalling 2 to the -K. Therefore, the probability that Wj=1 is 1 - 2 to the -K, which improves as K increases since the minimum probability of satisfaction (when K=1) is one-half, suggesting the satisfaction likelihood rises with clause size.
