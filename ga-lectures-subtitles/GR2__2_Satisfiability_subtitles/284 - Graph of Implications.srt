1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,185
 Let's take our input to the two set problem.

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:07,730
 This is the formula, F. And we can assume that all clauses are of size exactly two,

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,065
 as we just mentioned.

4
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:13,260
 And let's let N denote the number of variables in our formula.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,592
 Let's call them X1 through XN,

6
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:19,000
 and let's say M is the number of clauses in our formula.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,340
 We want to convert this logic problem into a graph problem.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,540
 So what we are going to do is we're going to take

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,580
 this Boolean formula and we're going to create a directed graph.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,160
 This graph is going to encode all of the information in this formula.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,410
 Now first off, the vertices of this graph are

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,110
 going to correspond to the variables of this formula.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,590
 There are end variables and there are two N literals, X1,

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,240
 X1 Bar, X2, X2 Bar, XN, XN Bar.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,235
 So we're going to have two N vertices.

16
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:48,215
 One vertex for each literal,

17
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,265
 and then we're going to have two M edges in this directed graph.

18
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:54,545
 We're going to have two edges for each clause.

19
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,945
 Each clause has two implications,

20
00:00:56,945 --> 00:01:01,700
 and the two edges are going to correspond to the two implications per clause.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,620
 Let's look at a specific example and then we can

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,450
 see what we mean by implications per clause.

23
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,400
 Here's a sample formula with three variables and three clauses.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,045
 Our graph is going to have six vertices corresponding to the six literals,

25
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,800
 X1, X1 Bar, X2,

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,220
 X2 Bar, X3, X3 Bar.

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,180
 And let's look at the first clause,

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,620
 X1 Bar or X2 Bar.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,175
 Suppose that we set X1 to be true.

30
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:27,615
 So this first literal is not satisfied,

31
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:31,875
 then we better satisfy the second literal in order to satisfy the formula.

32
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,945
 So if X1 is set to true,

33
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:35,655
 then what does that mean about X2?

34
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:39,540
 Then X2 better be set to false in order to satisfy this formula.

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,520
 Similarly if X2 is set to true.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,420
 So this literal is not satisfied,

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,700
 then we've got to satisfy the first literal.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,050
 So we need to set X1 to be false.

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,965
 So to encode these implications,

40
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:53,520
 we're going to add in the edge from X1 to X 2 Bar.

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,400
 If this literal X1 is satisfied so X1 is

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,240
 set to true then we have to satisfy the literal X2 Bar.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,780
 So we have an edge from X1 to X2 Bar.

44
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,480
 And similarly we have an edge from X2 to X1 Bar.

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:13,770
 Similarly, for this clause we have an edge from X2 Bar to X3 and from X3 Bar to X2.

46
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,430
 Finally, for the last clause we have an implication from X3

47
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,450
 to X1 Bar and from X1 to X3 Bar.

48
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,585
 So this is our graph corresponding to this formula.

49
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:28,620
 And in general if we have a clause which has literals alpha and beta,

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,275
 so we have alpha or beta is the clause,

51
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:36,810
 then we're going to have the edges from Alpha Bar to beta because if we don't satisfy

52
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,420
 alpha then we have to satisfy beta

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,420
 and we are going to have the other edges from beta Bar to Alpha.
