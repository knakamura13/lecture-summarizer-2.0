1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
 This is our example of an image from before.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,460
 Let's look at an example setting of the parameters in this case.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,400
 Here are example settings for the foreground and background likelihood for this image.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,600
 So we're saying that the white pixels are more likely to be in

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,530
 the foreground and the black pixels are more likely to be in the background.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,500
 For this image, we could have just as well reversed what we called foreground and

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,935
 background since we've defined the matrix to be symmetric.

8
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,240
 And here are sample separation penalties.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,640
 And when the pixels are different,

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,390
 we don't pay any penalty for separating the pixels into different objects.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,575
 Now keep in mind, this is very much a toy example.

12
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,310
 All the pixels are monochromatic.

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,310
 So we've chosen very simple weights in this example.
