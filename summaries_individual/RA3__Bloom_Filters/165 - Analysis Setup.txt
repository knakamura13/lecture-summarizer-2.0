Analyzing false positive rate in hashing schemes, database size M and hash table size N are key variables with ratio C (N/M) being critical, aiming for smallest C where C >= 1. In considering a non-database element X and likelihood of a false positive, denote the chance all K bits set to 1 despite no insertion of X into the database. Calculate single-bit set-to-one probability by the probability of a bit remaining 0 after M insertions. Each insertion equals tossing K balls into N bins, equating to MK ball tosses. A single bit B staying zero requires all MK balls to miss bin B, with each ball having a 1/N chance of hitting a given bin, so (1 - 1/N) chance of missing. The probability that a particular bit is set to one is one minus the probability it stayed at zero after all insertions (MK). Simplifying this expression is valuable for practical use.
