Exploring the Max-flow graph problem; focusing on the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm and proving its correctness. Will also cover the Max-flow min-cut theorem. Application to computer vision via Image Segmentation will be discussed. To address more complex scenarios, will delve into Max-flow with demand constraints and methods to simplify back to the original problem. Concluding with speed improvements brought by the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm.
