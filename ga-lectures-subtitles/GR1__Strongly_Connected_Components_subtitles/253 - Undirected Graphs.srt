00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
 For a given undirected graph,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,080
 how do we find it's connected components?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,560
 Well, we simply run DFS and we keep track of the component number.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,500
 So, each vertex is going to have its component number stored.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,660
 Let me remind you of this pseudocode for DFS,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,910
 because we're going to make some tweaks to it during the course of this lecture.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,345
 So, the DFS algorithm takes as input a graph,

8
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:21,840
 G. For now, let's think of G as an undirected graph.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,540
 But later, we're going to run the same algorithm on

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,535
 a directed graph and it's going to be identical pseudocode.

11
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:32,160
 And we assume that the graph is given to us in adjacency list representation.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,875
 And for now, we're looking at connected components of undirected graph.

13
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,700
 So, the vertices are going to be labeled by a connected component number.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,990
 We're going to have a counter which is the current connected component number.

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,030
 We're going to have an array which keeps track of whether we visited a vertex yet or not,

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,810
 and we're going to start off by initializing

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,860
 the visited array to false for all vertices of the graph.

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,890
 Now, we go through the vertices in an arbitrary order.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,060
 Now, if we get to a vertex that we haven't visited yet, what do we do?

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,150
 Well, this means that we found a new connected component.

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,545
 So, we increment the connected component number

22
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,340
 and then we start exploring from this vertex.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,340
 And let's now look at the subroutine for explore.
