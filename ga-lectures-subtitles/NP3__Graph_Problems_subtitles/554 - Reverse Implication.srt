1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
 Now, let's prove the reverse implication.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,850
 Let's take an independent set, S-bar,

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,870
 and let's prove that S is a vertex cover.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,020
 S-bar, we're assuming, is an independent set.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,325
 So what do we know? We know that no edge is fully contained in this set, S-bar.

6
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,710
 Therefore, we know that, at most, one of the endpoints,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,295
 x or y, is in the set, S-bar.

8
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:23,805
 If both endpoints, x and y, are in S-bar,

9
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,460
 then that means the edge is fully contained in the set,

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,900
 S-bar, and therefore, S-bar is not an independent set.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,140
 But since it's an independent set, at most,

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,310
 one of the endpoints or neither the endpoints is in the set, S-bar.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,710
 If at most, one is in S-bar,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,890
 then at least one is in S. Thus,

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,766
 S covers every edge of the graph,

16
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,430
 because for every edge of the graph,

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,670
 at least one of the endpoints is in S. And therefore,

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,326
 S is a vertex cover.

19
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,495
 This proves this direction,

20
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:54,400
 that if S-bar is an independent set,

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,320
 then S is a vertex cover.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,420
 And that completes the proof of the claim.

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:58,420
 Now, we can do the reduction.
