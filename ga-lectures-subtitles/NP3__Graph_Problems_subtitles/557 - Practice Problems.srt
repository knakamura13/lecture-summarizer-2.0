1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
 At this point, all of the practice problems at the end of Chapter Eight are relevant.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:06,120
 Here are a few of my favorite problems.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,815
 In problem 8.4, they give you a proof,

4
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:12,045
 a supposed proof of NP-completeness for a problem,

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,445
 and you have to spot the error in that proof.

6
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:16,650
 Now in problem 8.10,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,210
 there are seven subparts,

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,105
 and you have to prove that each of these problems that they present

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:24,720
 is NP-complete by doing a proof by generalization.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,580
 You have to show it's a generalization of a known NP-complete problem.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,915
 Some other nice problems are 8.14 where you do the Clique plus Independent set problem.

12
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:38,955
 So you're checking whether graph has a large clique and a large independent set.

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,510
 And 8.19, you consider the Kite problem.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,190
 Now in all these NP-completeness problems, there's two parts,

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,670
 yet the first show that the problem is in the class NP, that's usually trivial.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,440
 And then you have to take a known NP-complete problem and reduce it to this new problem.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,260
 Now, what's the known NP-complete problem you should use?

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,640
 Well, it's probably something similar.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,325
 So, for instance, this talks about clique and independent set,

20
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:07,250
 probably you should use clique or independent set here as the known problem.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,055
 If you're talking about a SAT variant,

22
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:12,420
 then you should probably use SAT or 3SAT over here.

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,860
 Now, there are roughly two flavors of NP-completeness productions.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,430
 The first is proof by generalization.

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,510
 You can show that this new problem is more general than a known problem.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,050
 Now, in some sense, we're always showing that

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,930
 this new problem is a generalization of the known problem.

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,280
 But what we mean by this proof by generalization is that you can just set

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,075
 the parameters here so that you get this known problem here.

30
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:40,490
 Now, the other type of reduction is you have to do a gadget.

31
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,500
 We did something like this for the 3-SAT proof.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,290
 What we do is we take the formula as input over

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,010
 here and we modify it in some way or we take a graph problem

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,310
 over here and input the graph problem here and we modify

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,035
 that graph by adding some small structure to that graph.

36
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,765
 We call that a gadget that we're adding in.

37
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,200
 So, those are the two main approaches.

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,980
 You're going to do proof by gadget.

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,480
 You're going to take the input here and you're going to modify it by adding

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,890
 some gadget to make an input for the new NP-complete problem,

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,665
 or you are going to do a proof by generalization.

42
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,625
 This topic is a little like dynamic programming.

43
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,460
 You have to do a lot of practice problems to get the hang of it.

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:18,460
 So, good luck and try a lot of practice problems from the text.
