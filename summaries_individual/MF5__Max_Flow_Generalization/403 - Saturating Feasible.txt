Proving that a saturating flow G' guarantees a feasible flow in G. By taking saturating flow F' in G', this allows the construction of feasible flow F in G. For each edge, flow in G set to the flow in G' plus its demand. F must be valid (inflow equals outflow for internal vertices and flow on edge does not exceed its capacity) and feasible (meeting demand constraints). F is feasible because F' non-negative ensuring F meets minimum demands. F also respects capacity constraints since flow F on edge E equals C' of E plus demand, where C' is the capacity in G' defined as original capacity C minus demand. Thus, F meets demand and capacity constraintsâ€”only need to verify inflow=outflow for every vertex to confirm F's validity.
