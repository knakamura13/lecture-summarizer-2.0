1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
 We've seen now how to find connected components in

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,180
 undirected graphs and how to topologically sort a DAG.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,980
 Both of these algorithms involved one run of a vanilla version of DFS.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,135
 Now let's look at general directed graphs.

5
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:14,970
 First we have to talk about what is the right analog

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,210
 of connected components for directed graphs.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,940
 It turns out to be strongly connected components.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,780
 And then we'll see an algorithm to find

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,560
 the strongly connected components of a general directed graph.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,025
 Now the amazing aspect is,

11
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,220
 that we're going to find these strongly connected components with

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,720
 just two runs of the vanilla version of DFS.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 Let's dive into this algorithm and let's start by defining strongly connected components.
