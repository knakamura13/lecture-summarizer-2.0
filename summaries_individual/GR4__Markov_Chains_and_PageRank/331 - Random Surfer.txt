Random walks on the web graph include hitting a random button which takes the surfer to a random web page with probability 1 - α, where α is the damping parameter between 0 and 1. At α = 1, the surfer never uses the random button, following only outgoing links. As α decreases below 1, the chance of hitting the random button increases. This models a surfer either choosing a random link from the current page with probability α or jumping to any page randomly with probability 1 - α. The ideal value for α, as used by Google, is approximately 0.85, balancing direct link-following with random page jumps.
