Analyzing the recurrence relation T(n) = 3T(n/2) + O(n), which originates from a sophisticated integer multiplication algorithm. After removing the big O notation, T(n) is defined recursively with a geometric series component and a linear term, leading to an expression involving i iterations of successive subproblems. The iteration stops when the subproblem size becomes 1, where i equals log base 2 of n. This stopping point is determined by the rate at which subproblem size is reduced in this recurrence, which here is by a factor of 2. This leads to a final expression in which T(n) is largely dominated by a term that grows proportional to (3/2)^log base 2 of n. Simplifying the expression, we see that the n from the O(n) terms cancels out with the denominator's n from the geometric series term, revealing that the solution to the recurrence is ultimately O(n^log base 2 of 3). This indicates that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial and specifically related to n raised to the power of log base 2 of 3.
