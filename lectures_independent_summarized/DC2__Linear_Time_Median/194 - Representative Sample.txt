Choosing the first n/5 elements of an array A as the subset S to determine a pivot results in a suboptimal pivot when A is sorted. The median of S in such a case would be the n/10th smallest element, leading to an imbalanced partition where the larger side can have up to 9/10ths of n elements. This makes the pivot ineffective for balanced partitioning as it skews the algorithm's running time towards a worst-case scenario (t(n) being reduced only to t(9/10 n) instead of the more efficient t(3/4 n)). Considering this, a more strategically selected set S, by incorporating some analysis of A, could potentially offer a better pivot for the algorithm.
