1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,355
 Now, one interesting feature of this example,

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:04,260
 is that there is a cycle in this graph.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,030
 There's a cycle that goes from C to F,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,990
 to E, to D and back to C. Now,

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,710
 this is a cycle in the original input graph in the flow network.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,300
 Now, we've seen for some other examples

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,475
 such a shortest path problem that cycles in the input graph can cause some issues.

8
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:28,705
 In that formulation, it's negative weight cycles which cause problems.

9
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:30,730
 So a natural question is whether cycles are

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,100
 okay in a flow network for the max flow problem.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,090
 Notice that a flow network has a cycle but our flow,

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,700
 our maximum flow is not utilizing this cycle.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,925
 And why is it not utilizing this cycle?

14
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:47,530
 Well, suppose that I had one unit of flow coming into D and then I send one unit flow

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,870
 along this entire cycle back to T and then send that one unit out of D. Well,

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,910
 I could just send it right from this edge into D and then out of

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,720
 D directly without going around the cycle so I could have bypassed the cycle.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,460
 So there's no reason to utilize a cycle in a flow network.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,900
 Now I may want to utilize part of this cycle and I don't

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,400
 know a priority which part of the cycle I might want to utilize.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,085
 So the main conclusion is that cycles are okay in a flow network.

22
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,305
 In fact they simplify the problem in some sense but the problem is

23
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:19,305
 well-defined regardless of whether there are cycles in the flow network or not.
