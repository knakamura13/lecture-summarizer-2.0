00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,065
 In this section, we'll look at the graph problem,

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:04,090
 known as the Max-flow problem.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,700
 It's a quite useful problem.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,950
 We'll first look at basic algorithm for the problem,

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,375
 known as a Ford Fulkerson Algorithm,

6
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:13,062
 and then we'll prove correctness of the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm.

7
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:14,250
 And along the way,

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,912
 we'll get the classic result known as the Max-flow- min-cut theorem.

9
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:20,850
 Next, we'll look at the nice application of

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,085
 the Max-flow problem to computer vision known as the Image Segmentation problem.

11
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,820
 We'll also look at a more general version of the problem,

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,420
 Max-flow with additional demand constraints,

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,425
 and we'll see how to reduce this more general problem to the original Max-flow problem.

14
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:39,230
 Finally, we'll see a faster Algorithm for the Max-flow problem,

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:39,230
 known as the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm.
