1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,910
 Let's dive into the proof that the Clique problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,460
 Now, there's two parts to the proof.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,535
 The first thing we have to prove is that the Clique problem lies in the class NP.

4
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:12,420
 As usual this is quite straightforward.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,720
 So consider an input to the Clique problem, a graph G,

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,070
 and a goal little g. And consider our proposed solution S. Now,

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,325
 we have to verify in polynomial time that S is a solution,

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:27,560
 is a clique of size at least g. To verify that S is a clique,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,980
 we consider all pairs of vertices in S. And we check that that pair of vertices,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,210
 x and y, are connected by an edge in the input graph G. Now,

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,730
 how long does this take us to do?

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,321
 What takes us the most order n squared time to consider each pair.

13
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,260
 And then for each particular pair,

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,150
 it takes as the most order n time to check whether they're connected by an edge.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,880
 So this takes in most order n cube time by a trivial algorithm.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,745
 Now that's sufficient for this proof since we just have to show polynomial time.

17
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:55,980
 But if you give a little bit of thought,

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,425
 you can easily do it in order n square time as well.

19
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,960
 That verifies that S is a clique.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,030
 Now we have to verify that the size of S is at

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,835
 least little g. That takes us order n time,

22
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:09,145
 and therefore it takes us polynomial time to verify that S is

23
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:12,960
 a solution to the clique problem on this input instance.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,085
 That establishes that the Clique problem lies in the class NP.

25
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,950
 It's a search problem. We can verify solutions in polynomial time.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,960
 The second step we have to show is that

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,180
 clique problem is at least as hard as every problem in the class NP.

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,691
 How do we do that?

29
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:28,710
 Well, we take a known NP-complete problem,

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,745
 and we show a reduction from the known NP-complete problem to the clique problem.

31
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:35,060
 Which problems do we know are NP-complete?

32
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,930
 We know the SAT problem is NP-complete,

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,380
 3SAT is NP-complete, and independent set problem is NP-complete.

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,415
 We're going to take one of these. Which one are we going to take?

35
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:45,420
 We're going to take the one which is most similar to the clique problem.

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,672
 Clique is a graph problem,

37
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,170
 so we'll take the independent set problem,

38
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,835
 which is also graph problem.

39
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:50,835
 So, we'll show that the Independent set problem reduces to the Clique problem.
