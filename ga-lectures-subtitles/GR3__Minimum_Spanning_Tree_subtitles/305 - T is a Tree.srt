1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
 Now let's first prove that T prime is a tree.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,290
 How do we construct T prime once again?

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,245
 We took the tree T and we added it in this edge e* that created a cycle.

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:13,990
 Now, along that cycle we removed any edge of that cycle.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,450
 In this case we removed, let's say,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,360
 this edge and let's call it e prime.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,370
 What we're going to show now is that we can remove any edge of

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,560
 this cycle and this result in graph T prime will be a tree.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,935
 Now, how are we going to show that the prime is a tree?

10
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:32,490
 Well, we're going to show that T prime is connected and it has exactly n-1 edges.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,635
 Now, if you recall from the beginning of the lecture,

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,635
 we said that if a sub graph has

13
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:42,270
 exactly n-1 edges and is connected then it must be a tree.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,284
 Now the fact that it has exactly n-1 edges is obvious.

15
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:49,479
 Why? Because T is a tree so it has exactly n-1 edges,

16
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,618
 we added one edge in and removed one edge.

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,775
 So we still have exactly n-1 edges.

18
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:56,695
 So what remains? We just have to show that it's connected.

19
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,970
 So take any pair of vertices y and z and let's show

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,000
 that there's a path between y and z in this sub graph T prime.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,405
 I chose a particular y and z in this example.

22
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:08,485
 So y is over here and z is over here.

23
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:13,980
 Now noticing T, there is a path between y and z of course because T is connected.

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,620
 The path goes along this edge e prime.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,400
 Now what happens in T prime?

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,540
 When T prime, I've removed this edge e prime.

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,010
 So this old path between y and z no longer exists in T prime.

28
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,560
 So let's let P denote the path from y to z in T in

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,120
 the original tree T. And now we have to construct

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,420
 a path in T prime which goes from y to z.

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,255
 Now, recall that when we looked at TUe* what do we get?

32
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:44,790
 We got a cycle, these blue edges are the cycle in TUe*.

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,595
 So let C denote the cycle in TUe*.

34
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:53,820
 Let's denote the end points of e prime as c and d. Now e prime is a path from c

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,765
 to d in T. Now this cycle C has two paths between c and d,

36
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,614
 e prime is one of those paths,

37
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:03,900
 let's take the other path.

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,875
 So let's look at this cycle C and take out the edge e prime, what do we have?

39
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:15,735
 We have a path and this path goes from c to d and all these edges in this path,

40
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,990
 exist in T prime because T prime contains

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,545
 all these edges except for e prime but we're not using e prime, we took e prime out.

42
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,810
 So we took the cycle,

43
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,980
 dropped off the edge e prime and this gives us a path from c to d in T prime.

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,130
 So, how do we get from y to z in T prime?

45
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,505
 Well, we're going to follow the original path P for whenever we hit this edge e prime,

46
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:46,280
 we replace this edge e prime by this new path P prime.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,595
 Now, to show that y and z are connected in T prime.

48
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:53,310
 So we want to show that there is a path from y to z in T prime.

49
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,890
 Well, we're going to use the original path in T

50
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,085
 and then whenever we hit the edge e prime,

51
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:03,480
 we're going to replace the edge e prime by this path P prime because

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,055
 the edge e prime does not exist in T prime but the path P prime does exist.

53
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,550
 So we're going to go along this path and now

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,310
 the original path uses this edge e prime but it doesn't

55
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,475
 exist now so we use the rest of the cycle.

56
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:23,650
 It gets over to d and then from d we follow the rest of the path P. So,

57
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,050
 actually, in this example we're backtracking.

58
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,820
 So this doesn't actually give us a path, it gives us a walk.

59
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,640
 But it shows that y and z are connected in T prime and then,

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,415
 of course, we can truncate this walk to make a path.

61
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:40,500
 But our whole point is to show that y and z are connected and that's all we need to show.

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,505
 We've shown that's the case for any y and z therefore,

63
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:43,505
 T prime is connected and since it has exactly n-1 edges then T prime is in fact a tree.
