Polar coordinates simplify multiplication of complex numbers: to multiply, just multiply magnitudes (r1 * r2) and add angles (θ1 + θ2). For a complex number Z with polar coordinates (r, θ), its opposite -Z equals the product of its polar coordinates and those of -1, which are (1, π). Thus, -Z has polar coordinates (r, θ + π), meaning -Z is a reflection of Z across the origin, maintaining the same distance r from the origin but with an adjusted angle θ + π. This reflection technique is useful for easily determining opposites in the complex plane.
