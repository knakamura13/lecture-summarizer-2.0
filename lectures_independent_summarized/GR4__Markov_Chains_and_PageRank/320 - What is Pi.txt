Stationery Distribution PI (probability distribution) for Markov chains can be calculated directly in cases of symmetry, where transition probabilities between states I and J are equal (p_i_j = p_j_i). In these cases, PI is uniformly distributed (PI of I = 1/N for all I). A generalization of symmetry is reversibility, which doesn't require equal probabilities but demands mutual accessibility between states (if an edge from I to J exists, one from J to I must too). With reversibility, PI can often be determined non-uniformly. Without reversibility, when edges between states only go one way, there's no closed formula for PI. In such instances, one might rely on raising the transition matrix P to a high power to estimate PI, but no simple formula exists as in reversible or symmetric cases. This overview serves as a foundation to further explore algorithms like page rank.
