1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
 Now looking into running time of this algorithm,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,670
 notice this step partitioning the vector a

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,770
 into a even and a odd that takes order and time.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,890
 This is a recursive call which is of size n over 2.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,595
 Similarly for a odd it's a recursive call of size n over 2.

6
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,215
 This computation of the Rs takes order one time for each pair.

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,115
 So takes order n total time.

8
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:24,720
 Therefore this running time satisfies the recurrence T event is 2T event

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:24,720
 over 2 plus order n. And of course this solves the order n log n that completes the FFTL.
