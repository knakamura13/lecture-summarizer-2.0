1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
 Let's take a moment now to recap

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,090
 the RSA algorithm and also the mathematics behind the algorithm.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,876
 We start with Fermat's little theorem,

4
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:10,050
 that was the basis of the whole algorithm.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,210
 Let's recap that. So the setting is,

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,765
 we have a prime number p and we have another number z,

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,900
 where z and p are relatively prime to each other,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,065
 which means that the GCD of z and p is one.

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,610
 This means that they're relatively prime if their GCD is one.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,690
 Now, the theorem says,

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,690
 if we take z and raise it to the power p_minus_one and we look at it mod_p,

12
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,800
 then what are get? We get one.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
 And that's true for any z,

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,610
 so take any z which is not a multiple of

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,810
 p and we raise it to power p_minus_one we get one_mod_p.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,665
 Actually, we didn't use Fermat's little theorem,

17
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:47,925
 we used the generalization known as Euler's theorem.

18
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,028
 Now Euler's theorem is a general theorem that holds for any capital N,

19
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:54,870
 but we used it for the particular case

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,490
 where capital N was the product of two primes, p and q.

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,155
 So let's recap it for this particular case that we're interested in.

22
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:04,215
 So, for primes p and q,

23
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:07,900
 look at their product, capital N, and take a z,

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,509
 which is relatively prime to capital N. Now in this case,

25
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:14,190
 if we raise z to the power p_minus_one_q_minus_one,

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,070
 then we get the analog of Fermat's little theorem.

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,315
 This is going to be one,

28
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,628
 when we look at it,

29
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:23,475
 mod_N, where N is p_times_q.

30
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:26,670
 Now, where did this exponent p_minus_one_times_q_minus_one come from?

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,470
 Well, that came from,

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,170
 we looked at how many numbers between one and capital N?

33
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,620
 This is the capital N here.

34
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,928
 How many numbers between one and capital N are relatively prime to capital N?

35
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:42,066
 For the case where capital N is p,

36
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:45,450
 then all numbers from one to p_minus_one are relatively

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,650
 prime to this N. So that's why the exponent is p_minus_one.

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,505
 For the case where N is p_times_q,

39
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:56,630
 then the number of numbers between one and p_times_q,

40
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,305
 which are relatively prime to it, are p_minus_one_times_q_minus_one.

41
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:01,305
 That's what we should solve before
