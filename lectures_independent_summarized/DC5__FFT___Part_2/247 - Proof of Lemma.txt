Proving lemma for matrix M inv. as 1/n times M with ω_n^-1. Rewritten, multiplying by M yields I on LHS and 1/n M(ω_n^-1) * M(ω_n) on RHS. I has 1s diagonally, 0s elsewhere. Must show diagonal entries of M product are n and off-diagonals (k≠j) are 0, satisfying I, with diagonal entries being 1 after multiplying by 1/n, confirming off-diagonals as 0. Focus on validating diagonal entries as n, off-diagonal as zero in two cases.
