Algorithm assumes no neg weight cycles, when present results incorrect. Detection of neg cycles essential, example with cycle total -1 shown. Algorithm revised to identify neg cycles; Focus on a vertex within cycle, outcomes D(n,a,a), D(n,b,b), D(n,c,c) should be -1. Negative diagonal matrix entries indicate neg cycles. Floyd-Warshall and Bellman-Ford algorithms detect neg cycles with diffs: former checks diagonals for all pairs, latter single source, both identify neg cycles.
