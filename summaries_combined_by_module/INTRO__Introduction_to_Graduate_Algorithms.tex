\section*{Introduction to Graduate Algorithms}

\subsection*{Overview}
Eric Vigoda is presenting a graduate-level, theory-heavy, math-oriented course on algorithms.
The curriculum includes Dynamic Programming, randomized algorithms with a focus on cryptography and hashing, advanced Divide and Conquer techniques like the FFT algorithm, and graph algorithms that tackle connectivity issues through DFS, applications to problems like the two-step problem and the Page Rank algorithm which is central to Google`s search engine.
The course will also cover max flow problem algorithms, delve into linear programming for optimization challenges, and conclude with computational complexity, specifically NP-Completeness.
Excitement for the comprehensive exploration of these topics is expressed with an invitation to dive in.
