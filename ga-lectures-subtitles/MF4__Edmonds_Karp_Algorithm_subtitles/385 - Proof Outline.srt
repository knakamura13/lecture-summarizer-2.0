1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
 Now we're going to prove that the running time of

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,100
 Edmonds-Karp algorithm is order m squared n. Now to prove that,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,210
 we're going to prove that the number of rounds of the algorithm,

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,044
 the number of times we augment the path,

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:14,040
 is at most m times n. Now in each round, we run BFS.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,850
 BFS takes linear time.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,825
 So assuming the number of edges is at least the number of vertices,

8
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,370
 that's order m time, therefore,

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,240
 it's order m time per round and order mn rounds.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,750
 So the total run time will be order m squared n.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,240
 So our main task is to prove that the number of rounds is at most mn.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,155
 As we just discussed,

13
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,400
 in every round, the residual graph changes from the previous round.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,550
 In particular, at least one edge is deleted from the residual graph in every round.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,110
 This edge corresponds to the one with minimum capacity along the augmenting path.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,170
 Now, edges make it add it back in in the residual graph.

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,300
 And in particular, this edge might be deleted in

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,120
 this round and in later rounds might be added back in.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,405
 Now what we're going to prove is that for every edge of the graph,

20
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:00,420
 we can bound the number of times that the edge is deleted

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,750
 in the residual graph and then reinsert it back later.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,940
 In particular, we're going to show that the number of times

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,170
 this edge e is deleted from the residual graph,

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,230
 and then later reinserted into the residual graph,

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,310
 is at most n over two times.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,455
 Now since there are m edges in the graph,

27
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,960
 and this holds for every edge of the graph,

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,725
 so we know that every edge is deleted at most n over two times,

29
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:25,345
 at least one edge is deleted in every round.

30
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:29,870
 Therefore, there is at most n over two times m total rounds.

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,920
 This gives our desired bound on the number of rounds of

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,740
 the algorithm which proves the desired running time.

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:34,740
 So let's dive into the proof of this key lemma.
