In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the vertex with the lowest post-order number is a sink vertex. When applying depth-first search (DFS) in general directed graphs containing cycles, it might be presumed that the same property holds—i.e., the vertex with the lowest post-order number belongs to a sink strongly connected component (SCC). This assumption, however, is incorrect; an example with three vertices (A, B, C) shows that such a vertex may actually reside in a source SCC, not a sink. Conversely, the opposite property is true: the vertex with the highest post-order number in a directed graph is always part of a source SCC, regardless of the DFS start point or neighbor order. This fact is accurate even when cycles are present, and it is useful for designing SCC algorithms—even though it does not help directly in identifying sink SCCs, which is often required. The proof of this property and its implications for SCC algorithms are anticipated but not included in this text.
