1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,026
 Now, the previous idea we just discussed takes a sink SCC,

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:06,795
 and it satisfies that sink component.

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:11,565
 And then the issues come in by worrying about the complement of that set.

4
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:13,025
 Let's look at the reverse idea.

5
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,940
 Instead of taking a sink strongly connected component,

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,040
 let's take a source SCC.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,580
 Let's call it S prime.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,960
 So we have the source component containing X4 and X2bar.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,870
 Now, it's a source so it has no edges coming in,

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,625
 it only has edges coming out.

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,490
 Now, for sink component we wanted to set it to true.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,665
 What do we want to do for the source component?

13
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,350
 We want to set it to false.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,690
 So by setting S prime to false,

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,190
 we're going to not specify each of these literals.

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,765
 That means X4 is not going to be satisfied so X4 is set to false.

17
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,180
 X2bar is not satisfied.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,305
 That means that X2 is set to true.

19
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:53,210
 Now, these literals are not satisfied but there are no incoming edges

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,370
 so there are no later implications which are going to cause problems.

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,980
 Moreover, because these literals are not satisfied

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,760
 we don't have to worry about the implications coming out of these literals,

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,760
 so we don't have to worry about these edges coming out.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,590
 We can safely remove this component and work on the remainder of the graph.

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,460
 But once again, what happens to the complement of this set?

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,075
 In this case, X4bar and X2?

27
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:23,030
 Well, it turns out that these are going to be in a strongly connected component,

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,390
 and this is going to be a sink SCC.

29
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,790
 So there might be edges coming in but there are no edges coming out.

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,125
 Now, if we set as prime to be false,

31
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,785
 that means we set its compliment to be true.

32
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,900
 So we satisfied all of these literals.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,640
 Now, if we satisfied these literals that means

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,950
 later implications are going to be satisfied,

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,920
 and there are no edges coming out so we don't have to follow any implications out.

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,960
 Now, it turns out that these two approaches are the same.

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,845
 That's why it works. We can take a sink SCC and set it to true.

38
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,230
 And at the same time,

39
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,470
 we can take a source SCC and set it to false.

40
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,435
 These are compliments of each other.

41
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:07,170
 If the component S is sink SCC then its complement set is a source SCC.

42
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,940
 This is what we're going to do,

43
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,390
 we're going to find a source SCC S prime,

44
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,480
 or we're going to find a sink SCC S prime bar.

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,035
 These are compliments of each other.

46
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:20,255
 If this is a source then this is a sink and vice versa.

47
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:21,905
 And we're going to set this source,

48
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,485
 vertices, to be false.

49
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,880
 So these literals are going to be

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,780
 unsatisfied and in the sink we're going to set them all to be true.

51
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,825
 We're going to satisfy all the literals.

52
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,115
 If we do one, then we do the other.

53
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:35,400
 And once we do this,

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,435
 then we can remove all these literals which appear in S prime and S prime bar.

55
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,665
 Now, for each variable which appears in one of these,

56
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:47,175
 this is going to remove the positive and negative literal.

57
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:49,305
 If the positive literal appears here,

58
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:50,545
 then the negative appears here.

59
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,990
 And if the negative appears here,

60
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,370
 then the positive appears here.

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,235
 We remove both the positive and negative literal,

62
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,125
 so that variable goes away.

63
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,850
 We can simplify the formula,

64
00:02:59,850 --> 00:02:59,850
 simplify the graph, and we can repeat.
