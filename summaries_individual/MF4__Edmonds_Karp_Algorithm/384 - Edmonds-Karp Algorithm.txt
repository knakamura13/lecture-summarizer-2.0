The Edmonds-Karp algorithm differentiates from the Ford-Fulkerson by exclusively using BFS to search for st-paths in the residual network. The algorithm's efficiency doesn't rely on integer capacities; any positive value is sufficient. An essential attribute of both Edmonds-Karp and Ford-Fulkerson is that during each iteration, the residual network must alter by at least one edge reaching full capacity and thus being removed in the subsequent step, whether it's a forward or backward edge. Additional edges may also be removed or added, and understanding these changes is important.
