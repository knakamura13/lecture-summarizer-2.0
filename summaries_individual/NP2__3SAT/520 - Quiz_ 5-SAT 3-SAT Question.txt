Transformed a clause of size 5 into 3 clauses of size 3 by introducing 2 new vars y & z. To ensure original clause C's satisfiability is equivalent to the new clauses C', C is replaced by C' in the orig. input F for an equiv. formula. New C' is to be defined with three literals each, using vars a-e (representing X2 bar, X3, X1 bar, X4 bar, X5) plus y & z. The task is to create C' satisfying the if-and-only-if satisfiability condition with C.
