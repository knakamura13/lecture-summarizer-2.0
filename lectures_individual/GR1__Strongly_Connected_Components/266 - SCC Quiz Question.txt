Here's a directed graph on 12 vertices. Let's go ahead and mark the strongly connected components in this graph, to make sure everybody understands the definition of SCCs. And then we can dive into some interesting properties of strongly connected points. First off, how many strongly connected components does this graph have? And now can you mark what are the strongly connected components in this graph?
