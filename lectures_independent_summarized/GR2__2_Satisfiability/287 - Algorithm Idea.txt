Use a strongly connected component (SCC) algorithm to find a sink SCC in a graph. Assign truth values to literals in the sink SCC to satisfy them, setting them to true, which means any complements are set to false. No outgoing edges from a sink SCC means no implications from these assignments. Once assigned, remove the sink SCC and repeat on the remaining graph. Key concern is ensuring the complement of the sink SCC (denoted S bar) is a source SCCâ€”having no incoming edges, it's safe to set S bar to false without worrying about subsequent implications. The process involves setting sink SCCs to true and ensuring their complements, if source SCCs, are set to false.
