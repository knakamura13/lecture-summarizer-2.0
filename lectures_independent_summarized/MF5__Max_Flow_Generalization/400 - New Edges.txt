Created network G-prime by adding edges from G; capacities are original capacities shifted by demand. Need additional edges to ensure valid G-prime flows equate feasible G flows. Zero G-prime flow equals demand levels in G (e.g., zero to three). In G, zero inflow at a node doesn't guarantee valid outflow due to demand. To rectify, add edges from s-prime to G nodes and G nodes to t-prime. s-prime to vertex v edges capacity equals v's demand in G. Edges to t-prime represent demand out of respective vertices. G-prime now structured to solve max-flow problem; viable solution corresponds to feasible flow in original network G.
