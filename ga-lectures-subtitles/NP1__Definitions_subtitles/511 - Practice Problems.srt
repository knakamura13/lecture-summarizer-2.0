1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,023
 Now, at this point, you should understand the notions of the class P

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:06,870
 and the class NP and the notion of reductions.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,050
 Now, we're going to see a lot of examples of proofs that a problem is NP complete.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,740
 So I don't expect you to be comfortable with that at this point.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,480
 But just based on these definitions,

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,660
 there are a few practice problems you can try from the textbook.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,222
 The first two problems in Chapter 8 of the textbook,

8
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,265
 Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani,

9
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,860
 are relevant at this point.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,110
 The first problem looks at reductions between optimization problems and search problems,

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,360
 and the second problem looks at reduction between search problems and decision problems.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,365
 Now, in the next lecture,

13
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:36,570
 we're going to do our first NP completeness proof.

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,570
 We're going to prove that three set is NP complete using the fact that set is NP.
