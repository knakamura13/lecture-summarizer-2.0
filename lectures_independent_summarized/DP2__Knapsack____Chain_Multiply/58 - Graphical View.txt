Matrix multiplication can be visualized using binary trees, providing an alternative perspective on parenthesization. In the binary tree, leaves represent the individual matrices (A, B, C, D), while internal nodes correspond to intermediate multiplications. The tree structure reveals the multiplication sequence: an example of multiplying A, B, C, and D in sequence is depicted by a tree where each parent node represents a progressive multiplication (AB, then AB*C, and finally AB*CD at the root). Another example illustrates the multiplication of A with B and C with D first, followed by multiplying the results, forming a different tree structure but with the same final product at the root. The organization of sub-trees indicates how multiplication operations are parenthesized and grouped in different scenarios.
