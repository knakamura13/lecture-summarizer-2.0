1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,305
 Now, let's look at the general formulation of this Dual LP.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:05,490
 Now, the original LP, the primal LP,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,965
 is of the following form.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,926
 Where maximizing C transpose X,

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,625
 subject to the constraints,

6
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,310
 a times x is at most b,

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,285
 and x is at least zero.

8
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:18,300
 Now, this LP has N variables,

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,380
 X is a vector of size N,

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,680
 and it has M constraints.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,395
 Capital A is a matrix of size M by N. It has M rows and N columns.

12
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,990
 Now, what is a Dual LP?

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,655
 Now, instead of maximizing, we're trying to minimize.

14
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,870
 We're trying to minimize the profit.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,365
 We're trying to find the smallest upper bound possible on the profit.

16
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:43,020
 We took a linear combination of these constraints,

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,320
 and the right hand side was our objective function.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,394
 We're trying to minimize the right hand side.

19
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:51,950
 The right hand side is defined by this vector b.

20
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,895
 So, our objective function is going to be minimize_b_transpose_y.

21
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:00,905
 Now, the right hand side of our constraints comes from the objective function,

22
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:03,335
 the coefficients and the objective function.

23
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:04,680
 So, there are constraints.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,720
 The right hand side is going to be at least C. How do we get the left hand side?

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,100
 We look at these constraints and we check which ones contain x1,

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,965
 the first and the third.

27
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,955
 What does that correspond to in this matrix A?

28
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,670
 That corresponds to the first column on the matrix A.

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,635
 The first column tells us which constrains contain x1.

30
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:30,825
 The second column tells us which constrains to contain x2.

31
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,275
 Second, third, and fourth.

32
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,802
 And therefore, we have a y2,

33
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,205
 y3, and y4 term.

34
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:39,110
 So, instead of looking at the matrix A,

35
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,555
 we're going to look at A transpose,

36
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:44,090
 because we're interested in the columns of A.

37
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,845
 And we're going to multiply this by Y.

38
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:51,215
 So, our constraints are going to be a transpose times Y is at least C. And once again,

39
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,505
 we have that Y is non-negative.

40
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:56,660
 So, given a primal LP in canonical form,

41
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,630
 this is the dual LP.

42
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,480
 And whereas the primal LP has M constraints,

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,835
 the dual LP has M variables.

44
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:07,220
 And the primal LP has N variables,

45
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,515
 the dual LP will have N constrains.

46
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:14,930
 One last note, in order to apply this formulation of the dual LP,

47
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,170
 we need that the primal LP is in canonical form.

48
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,810
 So, all the constrains have to be less than or equal to,

49
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,300
 and the objective function has to be a maximization problem.

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,300
 But, we discussed earlier how to convert any LP into canonical.
