1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,075
 The answer is zero.

2
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:03,570
 This sum is zero.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,360
 The sum of the nth roots of unity is zero.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,730
 Why is that true?

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,080
 Well, that follows just from the plus minus property,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,645
 which was the key to our divide and conquer algorithm.

7
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,745
 One is omega sub n to the zero power.

8
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:18,365
 What is omega sub n to the n over two?

9
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:21,210
 Well, if you think of the complex plane and the roots of unity,

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,865
 we're going halfway around the unit circle. This is negative one.

11
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,530
 They're opposites of each other.

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,305
 So when we add them up they're going to cancel each other out.

13
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:35,620
 Similarly, the jth of the nth roots of unity is opposite of the n over second plus jth.

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,930
 So the first n over two are opposite the last n over two.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,700
 They're are going to cancel each other out and we're left with zero.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:42,700
 This is true for any even n.
