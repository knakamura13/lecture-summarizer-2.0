00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 We saw in the last slide how to use

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,015
 the DFS algorithm to find the connected components of an undirected graph.

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:09,300
 Before we move on to directed graph,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,290
 let's gleam a little bit more information from the DFS algorithm.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,245
 In particular, suppose I have a pair of vertices,

6
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,550
 v and w which are in the same connected component.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,595
 I want to find a path between this pair of vertices.

8
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:25,170
 To do that, we simply have to keep track of

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,365
 the predecessor Vertex when we first visit a vertex.

10
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,390
 Here's the DFS algorithm once again for

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,165
 finding connected components of an undirected graph.

12
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:36,340
 We're going to use this previous array as is used in

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,585
 Dijkstra's algorithm to keep track of the predecessor Vertex.

14
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:44,040
 We initialize this previous array to null for every vertex.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,530
 And when we first visit a vertex.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,120
 So at this point in the algorithm,

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,500
 we should set its previous array to its predecessor Vertex,

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,005
 which is Vertex Z.

19
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,065
 So, we set previous W to Vertex Z.

20
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,560
 Now, after running DFS algorithm,

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,230
 given this previous array,

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,810
 we can use this previous array to backtrack.

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,125
 So, for a pair of vertices which are in the same connected component,

24
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:12,555
 we can use the previous array to find a path between this pair of connected vertices.

25
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:16,725
 That completes our discussion of DFS algorithms for undirected graphs.

26
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:16,725
 Let's move on now to directed graphs.
