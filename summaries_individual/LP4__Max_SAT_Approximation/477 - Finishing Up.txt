Established the probability of satisfying clause Cj by converting a product to a sum using the AM-GM inequality, then connected this sum to Zj using LP constraints, yielding an inequality. Demonstrated that the expression is no less than a k-independent constant multiplying Zj*. Simplified by comparing a series representation of e^(-x) and recognizing that (1 - 1/K)^K is bounded above by e^(-1/K)^K. This comparison led to a conclusion that the probability expression is at least 1 - 1/e times Zj*, validating the lemma for a 1 - 1/e approximation algorithm through an LP-based algorithm's analysis completion.
