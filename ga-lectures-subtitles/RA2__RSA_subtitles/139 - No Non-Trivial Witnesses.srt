00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,735
 Recall, for a number r, if we're checking whether r is prime or not,

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,045
 we say that z is a Fermat witness,

3
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:08,187
 if it proves that r is composite,

4
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:10,385
 according to Fermat's little theorem.

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,725
 What does that mean exactly?

6
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:16,590
 That means, that if z to the r minus one is not congruent to one mod r,

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,420
 then that z proves that r is composite.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,297
 Now, we say it's non-trivial,

9
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:26,260
 if in addition GCD of z and r is one,

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,155
 so z and r are relatively prime.

11
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,990
 Because if GCD of z and r is greater than one,

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,278
 so they're not relatively prime to each other,

13
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:37,890
 then that z gives us a non-trivial divisor of r,

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,900
 and therefore we know already,

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,660
 trivially, that r is composite.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,665
 Now, the question is, does every composite number have a non-trivial Fermat witness?

17
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,485
 We know it has a trivial Fermat witness.

18
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:54,353
 Namely, if it has a one of its divisors is a trivial Fermat witness,

19
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:57,055
 doesn't have a non-trivial Fermat witness.

20
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:02,460
 Well, in fact there are composite numbers which do not have non-trivial Fermat witnesses.

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,380
 These are called Carmichael Numbers.

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,292
 These are sort of pseudo primes.

23
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:11,280
 Okay. They behave like primes with respect to Fermat's little theorem.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,475
 A Carmichael number is a composite number r,

25
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,560
 which has no non-trivial Fermat witnesses.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,235
 Therefore, such a number is going to be inefficient to use Fermat's test,

27
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:26,790
 to prove that r is a composite number.

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,916
 We're going to have to find a different way to deal with Carmichael numbers.

29
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,410
 But, the key thing is that Carmichael numbers are rare.

30
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:39,000
 The smallest one is 561 and 1105 and so on.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,055
 But, since they're relatively rare,

32
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:44,520
 let's ignore them for now and when we ignore Carmichael numbers,

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,420
 we're going to have a simple algorithm to check whether number r is prime or not,

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,420
 using Fermat's test and trying to find a Fermat witness when it's composite.
