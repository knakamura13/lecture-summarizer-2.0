Investigating a toy problem with n identical balls thrown independently into n bins labeled B1 to Bn, focusing on the distribution of balls per bin, denoted as load_of_i for bin i. Chief interest lies in the maximum loadâ€”highest num of balls in any bin (max load = max_over_i(load of bin i)). In an extreme case, all balls could end up in one bin, with probability one_over_n_to_the_n, which is highly improbable. Hence, max load could be n, but typically much less. Aim to determine the likely max load under usual conditions, potentially expressed as square root n, log n, or order one.
