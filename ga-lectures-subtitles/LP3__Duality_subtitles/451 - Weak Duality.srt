1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
 Now, we can state that weak duality theorem.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,300
 This is an immediate consequence of how we formulated the dual LP.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,775
 Take a feasible point for the primal LP.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:13,080
 The value of the objective function in this case is C transpose X.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,490
 And recall, we're trying to find the X which maximizes this objective function.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,440
 Now, let's look at the dual LP.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,740
 Take a feasible point Y for the dual LP.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,795
 What's the value of the objective function for this dual LP?

9
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,105
 Well, that's B transpose Y.

10
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:31,560
 Now what we need to know is that any feasible Y gives

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,440
 an upper bound on the objective function of the primal LP.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,145
 So this B transpose Y is an upper bound on the objective function.

13
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,565
 So we know that C transpose X,

14
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:47,125
 this is a value of the objective function that we can obtain at the point X.

15
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:52,005
 This is upper bounded by the value of the objective function at Y which is

16
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:57,580
 B transpose Y. Y gives an upper bound on the objective function of the primal LP.

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,105
 And this is the value of an primal LP objective function that we can obtain.

18
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:05,520
 So the left hand side is the primal LP objective function,

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,490
 and the right hand side is a dual LP objective function.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,220
 Since any feasible point gives an upper bound on the primal LP objective function,

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,220
 we have this week duality theory.
