The nth roots of unity sum to zero due to the symmetry in their distribution around the complex unit circle. The plus-minus property employed in the divide and conquer algorithm demonstrates that each root has an opposite counterpart: for example, 1 (omega raised to the 0) and minus 1 (halfway around the unit circle). Pairs cancel each other out, with the first half of the roots negating the second half, resulting in a total sum of zero. This holds for any even integer n.
