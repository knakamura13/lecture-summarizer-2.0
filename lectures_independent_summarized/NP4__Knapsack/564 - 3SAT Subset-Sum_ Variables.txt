Specifying input for subset sum prob using number correlation to n literals. Vi → Xi true, Vi' → Xi false. Require exactly one of Vi or Vi' in subset S to reflect true/false assignment of Xi. Ensure no inclusion of both/no Vi or Vi' for clear Xi setting. Use base 10 to prevent digit carryover for independent digit behavior. T, as desired sum, must have one in Ith digit, achieved only by including Vi or Vi' (not both/neither) in S. This aligns subset sum solution to a definitive assignment of literals, satisfaction aside.
