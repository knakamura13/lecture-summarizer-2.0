In this example, we'll have four variables which we'll label X, Y, W, and Z. Now, our three-set input is the following formula. X-bar or Y or Z-bar, that's the first clause. Second clause is X or Y-bar or W. The third clause is X-bar or W-bar. Fourth clause is Y-bar or Z or W. Now, to start a construction of the graph, for each clause, we construct a vertex corresponding to each of the literals. So for this clause, we have three vertices corresponding to the literals X-bar, Y, and Z-bar. We have three vertices corresponding to this clause, two vertices for this clause, three vertices for this clause. Now we add the clause edges. So we add a triangle on these three vertices, a triangle on these three, an edge on this pair, and a triangle on these three. Finally, we want to add the variable edges. So we run an edge from X to all copies of X-bar. Similarly, from Y to all copies of Y-bar. From all copies of W to W-bar. Finally, from Z to Z-bar. Now let's look at an example independent set of size four in this graph. Let's say we take X-bar from this triangle, Y-bar, W-bar, and Y-bar. This independent set corresponds to the assignment X equals false because of this literal, Y equals false because of this and this literal, W equals false because of this literal, and Z has no constraints. And notice that such an assignment satisfies this formula. Let's prove that in general, that an independent set of size m in this graph corresponds to a satisfying assignment of this formula, and a satisfying assignment of this formula corresponds to an independent set of size m.
