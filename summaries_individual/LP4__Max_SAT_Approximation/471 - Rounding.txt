LP (linear programming) solutions yield optimal points denoted as vectors Y* and Z*. The task is to convert these to integers YI and ZJ, bearing in mind they may not be optimal. The challenge is to show that the integer solution found by rounding is close to the true optimal integer solution, which remains unknown. The rounding procedure should not significantly alter the objective function. Constraints in both LP and integer linear programming ensure variables are between 0 and 1â€”thus optimal solutions respect these bounds, allowing variables to be interpreted as probabilities. The solution uses randomized rounding where YI is set to 1 with a probability equal to its fractional optimal value and to 0 otherwise. Completing the algorithm provides a boolean assignment for the original variables: YI=1 sets XI to true; YI=0 sets it to false. This establishes a randomized method for assigning truth values, with an interest in expected algorithm performance.
