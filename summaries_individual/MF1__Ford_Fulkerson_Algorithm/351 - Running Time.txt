Correctness of the discussed algorithm linked to the Max-flow=min-cut theorem, proof deferred. Focus on algorithm's run time analysis under the condition that capacities must be integers. Relevance of this assumption tied to maintaining integer capacity in the residual network and ensuring each augmentation increases flow by at least one unit. Flow augmented by a minimum of one unit each iteration, implying a max of C rounds for the algorithm, where C represents the integer value of Max-flow sought. Upcoming Edmonds-Karp algorithm to address limitations of integer capacity assumption.
