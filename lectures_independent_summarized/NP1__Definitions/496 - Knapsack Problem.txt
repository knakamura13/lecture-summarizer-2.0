Examined SAT, colorings, and MST problems, all NP-class. Focusing on knapsack problem: involves selecting n objects each with integer weight (W) and value (V) to maximize total value within weight capacity (B). Two knapsack variants considered: with and without repetition of objects. Goal is to find subset (S) where sum of weights â‰¤ B and sum of values is maximized. Discussion applies to both knapsack variants.
