Max flow size ≥ capacity of min ST-cut is demonstrated. Prev shown max-flow size ≤ min ST-cut capacity. Using Ford-Fulkerson algo, for flow F* w/no augmenting path in resid network, an ST-cut (L,R) is constr w/capacity = size of F*. Showing size of F* = cap of (L, R) cut implies max flow size ≥ cap of min ST-cut. Since F* is a specific flow, its size is ≤ max flow, and cap of constructed (L, R) cut is ≤ min cut cap. Therefore, proving the equality for F* confirms the broader inequality: max flow size ≥ min ST-cut cap. Just need to verify the proposed equality.
