Exploring connectivity in graphs using DFS (depth-first search) algorithms, beginning with undirected graphs to determine connected components, a concept likely familiar. Moving to directed graphs, the focus shifts to their connected components equivalent. Examines DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) and topological sortingâ€”ordering vertices to have all edges pointing in one direction. This serves as a precursor to understanding algorithms for more complex directed graphs. The key goal is to identify SCCs (strongly connected components) in general directed graphs, which can be done by applying the DFS algorithm twice, a simple method despite the gradual build-up in the lesson. The journey from basic DFS concepts to SCC identification in directed graphs is paced to develop intuition before delving into the more advanced topic.
