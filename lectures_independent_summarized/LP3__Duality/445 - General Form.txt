In the general formulation of the Dual Linear Program (LP), the primal LP aims to maximize a profit function represented by C^T * X under constraints that Ax ≤ b and X ≥ 0, where A is an MxN matrix, X is a vector with N variables, and there are M constraints. In contrast, the Dual LP seeks to minimize the profit, essentially finding the smallest upper bound by minimizing b^T * Y. Its constraints are derived from the primal LP's objective function, resulting in A^T * Y ≥ C with Y also being non-negative. The Dual LP has as many variables as the primal has constraints (M) and as many constraints as the primal has variables (N). It's important that this Dual LP formulation requires the primal LP to be in canonical form—constraints must be inequalities in the "less than or equal to" sense, and the objective function must be maximization. Any LP can be converted to satisfy these canonical conditions before applying the dual formulation.
