So let's ignore Carmichael numbers for now since they're relatively rare. Let's assume that every composite number r, has at least one non-trivial Fermat witness. If we assume that it has at least one non-trivial witness, how many witnesses does it have, actually? How prevalent are these non-trivial witnesses? The key fact is that, if r has at least one non-trivial Fermat witness, then there are many non-trivial Fermat witnesses. In fact, if we look at the set of possible witnesses, one through r minus one, then at least half the numbers in this set are Fermat witnesses. Now, this is a relatively simple fact to prove and it's a very nice proof. The proof is in the book. But let's get the proof for now and let's try to use this, Lemma, to have an algorithm for checking whether a number is prime or not, when we ignore Carmichael numbers. So we assume that a composite number has at least one non-trivial witness. Then this Lemma tells us that at least half the numbers in this set are Fermat witnesses, are witnesses to the fact that r is composite. Can we use this fact now to get a test for whether r is composite or not? The point is that when r is prime, all of these numbers, when we raise them to the power r minus one is congruent one mod r. And when r is composite, then at least half these numbers, when we raise them to the power r minus one is, are not congruent one mod r. So how are we gonna check whether a number is prime or not? We're going to take a z, from this set, and raise it to the power r minus one. Look at mod r and see whether it's one or not.
