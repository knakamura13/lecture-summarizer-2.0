To solve max-flow problems, simplifying the flow network by removing anti-parallel edges is proposed. Simplification helps streamline upcoming algorithm development. Example given: a network with A-B and B-A edges is reworked by splitting one of these edges, introducing an auxiliary vertex, and preserving the original capacity, thus eliminating anti-parallel edges. The capacity distribution ensures the equivalency of max-flow between the two networks, enabling interchangeable solutions for the max-flow problem. This advancement aids in clean input preparation for efficient max-flow algorithm application.
