1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Now, suppose that we know that the SAT problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,150
 Now, in fact, we do know this.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,330
 What exactly does this mean?

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,515
 This means that SAT lies in the class NP.

5
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:11,355
 And, in addition, it means that,

6
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:12,915
 for all problems A,

7
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:16,920
 in the class NP we know reduction from A to the SAT problem.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,320
 Now, suppose we show that the SAT problem reduces to the independent sets problem.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,590
 Then, what do we know?

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,213
 We know that every problem A and NP reduces to SAT.

11
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:27,805
 So a reduces to SAT,

12
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,645
 and SAT reduces to the independent set problem.

13
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:34,410
 So, by just composing these reductions or composing these functions,

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,020
 we have a reduction from A to independent sets problem.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,305
 And this holds for every A and NP.

16
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,300
 Therefore, for every A and NP,

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,830
 we have a reduction from A to the independent sets problem.

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,303
 If we have a known NP-complete problem such as SAT,

19
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,785
 then to show that the independent sets problem is NP-complete,

20
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:56,295
 we just have to show that the independent sets problem lies in the class NP,

21
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:01,700
 and that there is a reduction from SAT to independent sets.

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,717
 To recap, to show that the independent sets problem is NP complete,

23
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,280
 we need to show the following.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,698
 The independent sets problem lies in the class NP,

25
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:11,035
 that's easy to do,

26
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,980
 and we have to take a known NP-complete problem such as

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,350
 satisfiability and we have to show how to

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,300
 reduce satisfiability to the independent sets problem.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,630
 We have to take the known NP-complete problem and

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,221
 reduce it to our new NP-complete problem.

31
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:29,569
 Since every problem A and NP reduces to SAT because SAT is NP-complete,

32
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,825
 and we just showed this reduction from SAT to independent sets problem.

33
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,200
 therefore, we know how to take every problem A and NP and reduce it to

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,165
 the independent sets problem and we can start from any known NP-complete problem.

35
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:46,860
 At the beginning, we'll start with SAT and we'll build up our repertoire of NP-complete

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,600
 problems and then we can take any of

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,930
 these known NP-complete problems and reduce it to our new problem,

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,995
 which we're trying to show as NP-complete.

39
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,860
 Now, it sounds much more tangible.

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,682
 To prove that a problem such as independence problem is NP-complete,

41
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:03,380
 we have to just show that we can verify solutions in polynomial time.

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,460
 That's the first step and then we have to take

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,150
 a known and complete problem and reduce it to this new problem.

44
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,225
 Now, the second step is what confuses students many times.

45
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,790
 Often, they'll show the reduction in the other direction.

46
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,680
 That's not really proving anything.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,900
 We already know that every problem in NP can

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,600
 be reduced to this known NP-complete problem.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,610
 And even if they marked it this way,

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,560
 that they're trying to do a reduction from set independent sets,

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,700
 actually, in the proof, they actually do the reduction the other way.

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,715
 It's meaningless if you do the reduction in the other way.

53
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:35,305
 So this is the difficult part for students sometimes.

54
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,500
 You have to make sure that you're doing a reduction from

55
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,780
 the known NP-complete problem to

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,260
 this new problem that you're trying to show as NP-complete

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,020
 because you want to show that you can reduce every problem and NP to

58
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,910
 this new problem in order to prove that this new problem is computationally difficult.

59
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,770
 It's NP-complete. So next,

60
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,810
 we're going to dive in and we're going to prove

61
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:54,810
 some problems such as independent set problem are, in fact, NP-complete.
