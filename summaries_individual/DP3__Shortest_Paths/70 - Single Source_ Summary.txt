Determining the shortest path from S to Z with a maximum of I edges involves a dynamic programming approach where the solution is established using the optimal scenarios for fewer edges. For I=0, we have the base case. When considering paths with I edges, the path could use either I-1 or exactly I edges. To resolve this, we compare the shorter of two paths: one found in the table D at I-1 edges (D of I-1 Z) or the shortest path from S to a penultimate vertex Y plus the last edge from Y to Z, taking the minimum for all possible Y. Recurrence relationship for D of I Z is then defined, where computation builds upon the subproblems involving I-1 edges. This process is repeated, incrementing I from 0 up to N-1, to create a functional dynamic programming solution to find the shortest path.
