00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 Before diving into Euclid's algorithm,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,505
 let's look at the basic fact which is called Euclid's rule

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,180
 which is the basis for Euclid's recursive algorithm.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,190
 Let's take integers X and Y.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,660
 And we want to compute the GCD of X and Y.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,870
 And let's assume for simplicity that X is at least Y. So the order.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,365
 And let's assume that Y is greater than zero.

8
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,970
 Then the basic fact is that the greatest common divisor of X and

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,120
 Y is the same as the greatest common divisor of X mod Y and Y.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,200
 And notice these are now in reverse order because Y is going to be at least X mod Y.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,100
 So if we want to compute the GCD of X and Y then given

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,630
 this fact we can compute the GCD of X mod Y with Y.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,975
 And that's going to be the basis of our recursive algorithm.

14
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:47,375
 But let's first see why this is true.

15
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,875
 Here's a basic proof idea.

16
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,510
 The proof relies on the following simple fact.

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,860
 The GCD of X and Y is equal to the GCD of X minus and Y.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,375
 Let's call this star.

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,660
 Notice, if we play star repeatedly,

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,050
 we get the theorem statement.

21
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,440
 GCD of X and Y is equal to the GCD of X mod Y and Y.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,700
 How do we get X mod Y?

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,765
 We get X mod Y by taking X and subtracting off Y repeatedly.

24
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,760
 Let's say Q times.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,905
 So we take off as many Y's as we can from

26
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:23,145
 X and then we take the remainder and that's X mod Y.

27
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:26,040
 So it keeps subtracting Y, and Y, and Y,

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,270
 and Y repeatedly until we're left with a number smaller than Y.

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,105
 So we keep applying this X minus Y.

30
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:35,490
 So we take X, X minus Y,

31
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,200
 and then that thing minus Y,

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,285
 minus Y, minus Y again, again.

33
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,279
 Q times and then we end up with X mod Y.

34
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:47,280
 So if we prove this fact star then that implies this theorem statement.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,120
 So it suffices to prove star and then that implies the theorem.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,095
 Okay, and then the star is a bit simpler statement than the theorem statement.

37
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,425
 So why's star true?

38
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:59,030
 Let's look at why that's true.

39
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,860
 You can think of this as if and only if.

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,485
 If a number D divides X and Y then it divides X minus Y and Y.

41
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:11,400
 That's the number D divides X minus Y and Y then it divides X and Y.

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,110
 So any divisor of these two,

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,530
 it's a divisor of these two.

44
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,690
 Any divisor of these two,

45
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,765
 it's a divisor of these two.

46
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,585
 If we prove that, we're done.

47
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:20,790
 So we can think as a if and only if.

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,710
 Given a divisor here of these two, it divides these two.

49
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,260
 Let's do that statement first.

50
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,625
 If D divides X and Y then clearly it divides Y.

51
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,285
 Ready. And D divides X minus Y as well.

52
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:37,190
 If it divides X and Y then it obviously divides X minus Y as well.

53
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,615
 You can factor out D from X and from Y so you can factor it out from X minus Y.

54
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,820
 That gives this one direction, the forward direction.

55
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,520
 What about the reverse direction?

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,590
 So if D divides X minus Y and Y then D

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,730
 divides X as well because X is just the sum of X minus Y plus Y.

58
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,680
 So it divides both of these then it divides their sum.

59
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,470
 So that gives us the reverse direction therefore they have all the divisors in common,

60
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,515
 so the greatest divisor is also in common.

61
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:08,924
 That proves this statement star which implies this Euclid's rule.

62
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:11,325
 Here is Euclid's rule that we saw in the last line.

63
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:16,050
 GCD of X and Y is the same as the GCD of X mod Y and Y.

64
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,577
 Now, let's use that basic fact and design of recursive algorithm for computing the GCD.

65
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:21,577
 It's called the Euclid's algorithm.
