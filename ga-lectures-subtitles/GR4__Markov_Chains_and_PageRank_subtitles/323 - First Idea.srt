00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,919
 So imagine you're studying for your PhD,

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,715
 and you're trying to come up with some measure for the importance of web pages.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,325
 So you might think of the analogy with academic papers.

4
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:11,270
 What's the importance of an academic paper?

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,750
 How do you measure the importance of an academic paper?

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,630
 Well one way that we still use,

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,460
 is using citation counts.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,718
 How many other papers cite your paper?

9
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:22,615
 What does that mean in terms of web pages?

10
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:24,240
 Well might be the number of links,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,210
 hyperlinks to your web page.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,340
 So our first idea for defining the rank of a page x,

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,510
 is to define pi of x to be the number of links to the page x,

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,670
 number of hyperlinks to the web page x.

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,705
 In terms of the graph, this means we're going to look at the number of in neighbors to x.

16
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:39,705
 How many edges come into x.
