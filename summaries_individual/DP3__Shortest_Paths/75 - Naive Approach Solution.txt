The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a single-source shortest path solver that employs dynamic programming and runs in O(nm) time, with n being the number of nodes and m the number of edges in a graph. This runtime is achieved by using an approach that iterates through all possible numbers of edges in a path (up to n-1) and through all the edges in the graph. Running Bellman-Ford n times results in a runtime of O(n^2m). In contrast, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, designed to tackle the same problem, operates with a time complexity of O(n^3), which can be more efficient since m might be as large as n^2. The algorithms' names are not as crucial as understanding their dynamic programming concepts, which help reconstruct their running times and eventually the algorithms themselves. Both algorithms utilize distinctive dynamic programming methods distinct from previous examples, with Floyd-Warshall being the more time-efficient choice for certain connected graphs.
