Let's prove the reverse implication that a satisfying assignment for the 3SAT formula corresponds to a solution to the subset-sum instance. So let's take a satisfying assignment for f, and we'll construct a solution to the subset-sum instance in the following manner. In our satisfying assignment, if we set the variable X to the ith to true, then we add the number V to the ith to the solution S. And if we set the variable X to the ith to false in our satisfying assignment, then we add the number of V to the ith prime to our solution S. We're adding exactly one of V to the ith and V to the ith prime to S. This means, in the ith digit, we get exactly one. So the ith digit of T is correct. Now let's look at the jth clause. We started from a satisfying assignment, therefore, at least one of the literals in this clause is satisfied. The numbers corresponding to these literals give us a sum of one, two, or three in the digit n plus j. T has three in digit n plus j. So how do we achieve a sum of three digit n plus j? Well, using the numbers corresponding to these literals, we get a sum of one, two, or three, and then we can use S to the jth and/or S to the jth prime to get up to a sum of three. This ensures that digit n plus j is correct and therefore, the last m digits are correct and the first digits are correct. And therefore, we have a solution to the subset-sum instance. So we've proved this equivalence and we've proved that our reduction is correct.
