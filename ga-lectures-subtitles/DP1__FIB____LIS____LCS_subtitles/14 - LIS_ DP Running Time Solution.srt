1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
 We have one for loop,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,305
 which varies over order n elements,

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:06,240
 and we have another nested for loop,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,060
 which varies over, at most, n elements.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,115
 Within these two nested for loops,

6
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,365
 we have a if-then statement,

7
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,195
 which takes order one time.

8
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:21,160
 Therefore, the total time for these nested for loops is, order n-squared time.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,865
 Finally, we have another for loop which finds a max entry in the table.

10
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:25,950
 This is one for loop,

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,540
 it's not nested, this is order n time.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:28,540
 Therefore, the total run time of our algorithm is order n-squared time.
