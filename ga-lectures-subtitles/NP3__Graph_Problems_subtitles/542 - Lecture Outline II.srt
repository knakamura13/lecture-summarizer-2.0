1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
 We just saw how to show that the independent set problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,167
 Now that reduction was quite interesting since it involved a reduction from SAT,

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,925
 which is a logic problem,

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,435
 to this graph problem, Independent sets.

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:16,850
 Now, will show that the Clique problem and vertex cover problem are NP-complete.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,680
 These will be much easier since we now have a graph problem,

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,840
 independent sets to start from.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:21,840
 Let's dive into the clique problem.
