1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 Now let's formally state the max flow problem.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,330
 The input to the max flow problem is what is called a flow network.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,190
 A flow network consists of

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,240
 a directed graph G. Here's an example of a directed graph again.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,890
 Now in this directed graph we have two vertices labeled s and t,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,380
 corresponding to the source and the sync for the flow in our problem.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,785
 Finally for each edge,

8
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:26,070
 we're given a capacity which is a positive number.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,410
 Here are the example capacities from before for this network.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,860
 And our goal is to maximize the flow which is sent from s to

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,960
 t. So the flow originates at s and it ends at

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,740
 t. Now we use the variable f_sub_e to denote

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,390
 the flow along edge e. Now these are the variables which we're trying to determine.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,035
 So our goal is to specify the flow along

15
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:48,035
 every edge so that we maximize the flow from s to t.
