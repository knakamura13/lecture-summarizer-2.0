Prepared for Chapter 6 problems in Gupta Papademetriou Abaza Ronnie algorithms textbook. Key problems include: - 6.17 on change-making with different coin denominations and valuesâ€”advised to attempt all three variants. - Problem 20 focuses on building an optimal binary search tree. - Problem 7 looks for the longest palindrome subsequence and a variant targeting contiguous palindrome substrings. Key lessons from lecture: - Start with prefixes when devising subproblems; move to substrings if needed. - After solving with substrings, re-evaluate necessity for substrings which could simplify the solution and lead to faster algorithms. - Priority is a correct algorithm, even if slower; efficiency can be optimized later. - Proficiency in dynamic programming comes from extensive practice with varied problems from textbooks and online sources. - Achieving ease with dynamic programming relies on recognizing patterns through repeated practice.
