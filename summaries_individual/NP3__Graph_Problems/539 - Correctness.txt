Proving a satisfying assignment for three set input F equates to an independent set of size at least g in a constructed graph. Forward direction proved by starting with a satisfying assignment for F leading to an independent set of size g. For each clause in F, one satisfied literal chosen, corresponding to a graph vertex, added to set S. Size of S is m (the number of clauses), matching goal size g, thus achieving required size. S only contains one vertex per clause, does not contain contradictory variables (X_i and X_i bar simultaneously) based on the assignment's truth values. No clause edges or variable edges in S, meaning it's edge-free. S is confirmed as an independent set, fulfilling the forward direction proof by creating an independent set size g from a satisfying F assignment. The reverse direction remains to be shown.
