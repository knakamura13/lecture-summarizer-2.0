To calculate the PageRank, one must determine the stationary distribution vector, pi. Start with any initial distribution, expressed as vector Mo. Multiply Mo by the transition matrix P to the power of t, through T iterations of the Markov chainâ€”only a small number of steps is typically required due to rapid mixing from the probability (1-alpha) of selecting a random page. Convergence can be checked empirically. For massive web graphs, use the previous week's pi as a starting point to approximate the current pi efficiently. Since the number of web pages (N) is very large, computing pi traditionally is impractical as it would take N squared time and space. Instead, computation must be done in linear time, order m, where m represents the number of edges in the web graph. This usually scales with N, being linear instead of N squared, making the process feasible for large networks. The described approach outlines the practical implementation of the PageRank algorithm in a resource-efficient manner for extensive web graphs.
