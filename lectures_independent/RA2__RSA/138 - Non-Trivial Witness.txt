Now we call this Fermat witness that we just derived a trivial Fermat witness. Why is it a trivial Fermat witness? This is a Fermat witness, z, where it also has the property that the greatest common divisor of z and r is greater than 1. So z and r are not relatively prime. Notice, such as z already proves that r is composite. If z and r have a non-trivial divisor, then we know that r has a non-trivial divisor, and therefore, it's not prime. So, any z where this is the case, proves that r is composite, there's no reason to run Fermat's test. So that's why we called such a z, a trivial Fermat witness. Now there always exists a trivial Fermat witness for composite numbers. Why? Because every composite number has at least two non-trivial divisors. The question is whether a composite number r, has a non-trivial Fermat witness. This is a number z which is relatively prime to r. Now it turns out that some composite numbers have no non-trivial Fermat witnesses, these are called pseudo primes, but those are relatively rare. For all the other composite numbers, they have at least one non-trivial Fermat witness, and if they have at least one, then in fact, they have many Fermat witnesses. And therefore it will be easy to find a Fermat witness and that's the key point. Trivial Fermat witnesses always exist. Every composite number has at least two trivial Fermat witnesses. But if a composite number has a non-trivial Fermat witness, then there are many Fermat witnesses, they're dense and therefore they're easy to find. And that's what we'll utilize for our primality testing algorithm.
