Developing a method for matrix chain multiplication with parameters I and J defining the start and end of a substring of matrices. For a series of matrices A_i through A_j, the subproblem C(i,j) represents the minimum computation cost for their product. The base case is when I equals J, for a single matrix A_i the cost is zero, represented by the diagonal in matrix C. The focus is on the upper diagonal, seeking a general recurrence for C(i,j) to calculate the minimum multiplication cost.
