00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 We saw that we need to consider complex numbers for our choice of the n

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,735
 or two n points where we evaluate the polynomial A(x).

3
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:11,840
 Here, I'll give a brief review of the relevant concepts regarding complex numbers.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,860
 Some of you may get a bit scared at the use of

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,310
 complex numbers but the mathematics involved is fairly simple,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,105
 so don't get intimidated at all.

7
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:23,330
 And the final algorithm that we get is very simple and very beautiful.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,850
 We have a complex number Z which is a plus bi.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,950
 A Is the real part and B is the imaginary part.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,405
 It's often convenient to look at complex numbers in the complex plane.

11
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,710
 In the complex plane,

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,420
 one of the axis corresponds to

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,255
 the real component and one of the axis corresponds to the imaginary component.

14
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,800
 So, for this number A plus bi,

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,000
 we look at A in the real axis,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,215
 B in the imaginary axis and we look at this point ab.

17
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:54,930
 This number Z corresponds to the point ab in the complex plane.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,050
 Now, there's another way to describe this point,

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,030
 this number Z and it's called the polar coordinates.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,130
 In polar coordinates, we look at the length of

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,240
 this vector from the origin to this point Z.

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,250
 Let's call R, the length and we look at this angle theta.

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,030
 This number Z in polar coordinates is R comma theta.

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,765
 Just as we had two representations of a polynomial,

25
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,425
 either the coefficients or the values.

26
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:21,315
 We also have two representations of a complex number.

27
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:27,090
 Either, with the cartesian coordinates ab or the polar coordinates R theta.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,950
 Now it turns out the polar coordinates are more

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,460
 convenient for certain operations such as multiplication.

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,935
 Before we delve into properties of polar coordinates,

31
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:37,150
 let's review some basic properties.

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,735
 First off, how do we convert between polar coordinates

33
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:42,730
 and complex or cartesian coordinates?

34
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,730
 Well, if you remember a little bit of trigonometry,

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,520
 you'll recall that A,

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,470
 this length A is equal to R times

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,270
 cos theta and this length B is equal to R times sin theta.

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,340
 So, this gives us a way to convert between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates.

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,160
 Now there's a third way of representing complex numbers.

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,610
 This is given to us by Euler's formula.

41
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,300
 This gives us a quite compact representation of complex numbers.

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,515
 The basic fact is Euler's formula,

43
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:18,330
 which says that cosine theta plus I times sin theta equals exponential of i times theta.

44
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,425
 Then we can multiply both sides by R and then we have that this number Z,

45
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:28,745
 this complex number Z equals R times exponential of i times theta.

46
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:32,070
 The basic idea of the proof of this Euler's formula is by looking at

47
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,070
 the Taylor expansion of exponential function cosine and sine function.
