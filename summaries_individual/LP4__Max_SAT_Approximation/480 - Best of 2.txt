Combined algorithm uses a simple randomized method and an LP-based scheme to assign boolean values to variables in an input formula F. The algorithm chooses the assignment from these methods that satisfies the most clauses, M1 or M2. The expected performance of this algorithm is the max of M1 and M2, proven to be at least three-quarters of the optimal value of satisfied clauses, independent of clause length variations in F. Thus, we obtain a three-quarters approximation for max satisfiability problems, even with mixed clause lengths. Further calculus details are available in online notes.
