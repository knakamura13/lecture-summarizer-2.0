Markov chain four states, looking at trajectories in unweighted, weighted graphs. Adjacency matrix simple: State 1 connections 1 1 0 0. Matrix "A squared" from matrix A multiplication indicates number of paths of length 2 between states: value 2, State 1 to itself via two paths, e.g. self-loop/self-loop or State 2 and back. Entry 4,1 shows paths State 4 to 1 also two ways: self-loop then edge or vice versa. Entry 4,2 is one, only one path—State 1 then State 2. No paths 4 to 3 of length 2, thus "A squared" entry 4,3 is 0. Weighted graph transition matrix reflects Markov chain probabilities instead of path counts. Matrix P accounts for probabilities of staying or moving states. "P squared" from matrix P multiplication, similar to "A squared," but instead, entries indicate total probability weight of length 2 paths between states. For instance, entry 4,3 is 0—no length 2 paths between State 4 to State 3. Entry 2,1 in "P squared" shows probability 0.31 from State 2 to 1 in two steps, accounting for all possible intermediate pathways and their respective probabilities, like 2→1 with self-loop and 2→4→1. Overall, matrices "A squared" and "P squared" encapsulate, respectively, count of paths and probability weights for two-step transitions between states in a Markov chain's unweighted and weighted graphs.
