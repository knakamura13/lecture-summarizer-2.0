00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 To get some intuition for this problem,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,260
 I want to look at an alternative representation of the problem and

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,770
 instead of looking at it as parenthesization

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,665
 we're going to represent it as a binary tree.

5
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,885
 Let's go back and look at our earlier example to see what we mean here.

6
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,905
 In our earlier example, we were looking at the product of four matrices,

7
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,200
 A times B times C times D. Now,

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,010
 the standard way of computing this was A times B and take

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,790
 that times C and then take

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,120
 that times D. Now we're going to represent this as a binary tree.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,750
 The leaves of the trees are going to be the four matrices and

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,730
 the internal nodes are going to represent the intermediate computations.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,410
 So, the root is going to represent the final computation,

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,840
 A times B times C times D. Now,

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,450
 for this parenthesization our first computation is A times B.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,450
 So, we have the leaves for A and

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,095
 B and our first computation corresponds to the parent of those leaves,

18
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,650
 which corresponds to A Times B.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,080
 Then, we take that matrix and multiply it by C. So,

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,765
 we have to leaf for C and then we have the parent of A times B and C,

21
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,855
 which corresponds to A times B times C.

22
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:10,440
 This internal node corresponds to A times B times C. How

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:18,275
 the subtree is structured tells us how the parenthesization is done for this subproblem.

24
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:22,200
 Finally, we take A times B times C and we multiply by D. So,

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,075
 this tree captures this parenthesization.

26
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,885
 Here's another parenthesization we can do

27
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:31,680
 A times B and we can do C times D and then we multiply those two together.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,140
 This is represented by the following tree.

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,095
 We first compute A times B.

30
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,160
 Then we compute C times D. So,

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,070
 this represents A times B.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,150
 This represents C times D. And then,

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,945
 we multiply those two together.

34
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:45,840
 This gives us our final matrix,

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,940
 A times B times C times D. So,

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,915
 the roots of these two trees represent the same product,

37
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:51,915
 A times B times C times D. How this subtree is structured tells us the parenthesization.
