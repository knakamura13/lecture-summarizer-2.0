Linear programs in standard form involve a vector X of N variables and M constraints shaping a convex feasible region â€“ a convex polyhedron in N dimensions formed by the intersection of M half-spaces. The simplex algorithm operates by traversing the vertices of this polyhedron, because the optimum of the objective function is found at these vertices due to the convexity of the feasible region. However, this is not universally applicable, prompting further exploration of the conditions under which this holds true.
