1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
 Take a look at the basic idea of this simplex algorithm.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,025
 We want to start at some feasible point.

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:07,105
 Well, we start at the zero vector.

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:09,240
 This is the vertex of the feasible region,

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,769
 because it satisfies the N non-negativity constrains with equality.

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,350
 Now, of course we still have to check that this point satisfies the other M constraints.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,585
 Now, if it does not satisfy any of the M constraints,

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,429
 then we know that this point is not in

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,760
 the feasible region and therefore the feasible region is empty.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,089
 So this LP is infeasible.

11
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,450
 There are no X which satisfy all of the constraints.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,719
 Now, this starting point is feasible.

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,369
 Then we're going to do a sort of local search.

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,280
 So, we're going to look at the neighboring vertices and we're going to try to

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,490
 find one with higher objective value. What do we mean?

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,039
 We mean that the value of the objective function is

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,259
 higher and we want one which is strictly higher.

18
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,030
 Now recall there are most N times M neighboring vertices.

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,174
 So, in the worst case we can check all the neighboring vertices.

20
00:00:57,174 --> 00:00:59,070
 Now, if we find a neighboring vertex with

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,225
 higher objective value then we move there and then we repeat.

22
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:04,665
 So, for this new point,

23
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:08,250
 we'd look for a neighboring vertex which has higher objective value.

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,444
 And we continue, keep repeating.

25
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:14,700
 Now, what do we do if there is multiple neighboring vertices with higher objective value?

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,599
 Well, that's one of the heuristics of the variance of simplex algorithm.

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,685
 We could choose one of them at randomly.

28
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:24,519
 We could take the neighboring vertex with highest object of value.

29
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,480
 There's various heuristics that we can use.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,590
 But what happens in the case that

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,935
 this current point is better than all of the neighboring vertices?

32
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,129
 Well, recall our feasible region is

33
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:40,224
 a convex polyhedron and we're walking on vertices of this convex polyhedron.

34
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:44,784
 So we're at some vertex and all the neighbors are smaller than it.

35
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:47,765
 Since it's convex, it can't go down and then back up.

36
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,829
 So, if all the neighbors are smaller than it,

37
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,180
 then the whole convex,

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,484
 the whole feasible region is smaller than it.

39
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:56,430
 So, the current point must be the optimum.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,719
 So, we simply output the current point and this is guaranteed to be the optimal,

41
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,954
 the global optimal of the LP.

42
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:05,760
 To solidify the idea of the simplex algorithm,

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,789
 we're going to illustrate it on one of our examples.

44
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,973
 So, let's go back to our three dimensional example,

45
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:10,973
 our example with three variables and implement the simplex algorithm on that example.
