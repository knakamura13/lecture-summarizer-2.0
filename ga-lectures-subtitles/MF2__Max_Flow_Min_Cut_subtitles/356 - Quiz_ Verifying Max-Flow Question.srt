00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,175
 Let's look at an important consequence of dilemma we just stated on the previous slide.

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,565
 Given a flow network,

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,755
 so an input to the Max-flow problem,

4
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:10,020
 and given a particular flow F,

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,910
 what is the time required to check whether this particular flow F is a Max-flow or not?

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,332
 Specify your answer in big O notation, in terms of N,

7
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:21,560
 the number of vertices in the flow network,

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:21,560
 and M, the number of edges in the flow network.
