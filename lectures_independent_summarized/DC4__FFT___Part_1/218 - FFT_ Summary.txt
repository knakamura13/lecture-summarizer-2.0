Evaluating polynomial A(x) of degree n-1 at 2n points, x_1 through x_2n, is essential for polynomial multiplication. Initially, 2n points are chosen to construct Aeven and Aodd from the even and odd terms of A(x), reducing their degrees by half. The FFT algorithm is recursively applied to these two polynomials at n points, y_1 through y_n, which are the squares of the original 2n points and maintain a plus-minus property. Knowing values of Aeven and Aodd at x^2 allows for efficient evaluation of A(x) at x; this parallel process at 2n points requires linear time. The algorithm's time complexity is comparable to merge sort, following T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) and resolving to O(n log n). The plus-minus property must hold for all recursive levels, implying that the original and all subsequent 2n points adhere to this criterion, which forms the computational challenge of the algorithm.
