Proved subset sum problem (SSP) NP-complete. Now show knapsack problem (KP) NP-complete. Correct NP version of KP needed. For NP-completeness: 1) prove KP in NP, 2) reduce known NP-complete problem to KP. Use SSP as it’s similar to KP for reduction. It’s about direction: take SSP input, transform to KP input, then transform KP solution back to SSP solution. Avoid common mistake of wrong direction in reduction. Essential: properly reduce from known NP-complete problem to target problem.
