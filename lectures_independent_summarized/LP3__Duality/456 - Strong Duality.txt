Strong duality theorem ensures that a feasible and bounded primal linear programming (LP) problem has an equivalent dual LP problem that's also feasible and bounded, with optimal solutions existing for both. Optimal values of objective functions are equal, with C transpose X star equaling B transpose Y star, where X star and Y star represent optimal points in the primal and dual LPs, respectively. This theorem provides a certificate for optimality in LP problems. Specifically, in max flow problems, the theorem equates the value of the objective function (size of max flow from S to T) in the primal LP to the capacity of the min st-cut in the dual LP, thereby proving the max flow min cut theorem using the strong duality principle.
