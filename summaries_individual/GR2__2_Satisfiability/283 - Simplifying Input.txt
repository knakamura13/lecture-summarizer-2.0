Addressing 2-SAT problem with input F of variables x1 - x4 and five clauses by simplifying to remove unit clauses. Unit clauses (single literal) determine variable state to satisfy clause; x1 assigned false, simplifying formula. Process eliminates clauses containing negation of assigned literal and removes satisfied literals from other clauses, creating F prime reduced formula. If new unit clauses form, procedure repeats until formula is empty or only contains two-literal clauses. Claim: original formula F satisfiable iff F prime is satisfiable. Process naturally leads to assumption that all 2-SAT problem inputs can be reduced to clauses of size two â€“ simplifies problem solving, closely relates to strongly connected components algorithm used in solving 2-SAT.
