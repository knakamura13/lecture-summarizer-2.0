Strongly connected components (SCCs) in a graph limit reachability when starting from different vertices. Ideally, the graph should have a single SCC, making it irreducible, meaning all vertices are strongly connected. Easily achieved by making the graph complete with all entries in transition matrix P positive, ensuring a positive probability of transition between any pair of vertices, thus making P irreducible.
