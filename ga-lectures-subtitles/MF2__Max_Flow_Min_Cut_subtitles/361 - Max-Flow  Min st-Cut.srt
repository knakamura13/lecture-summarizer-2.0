00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 Recall, we want to show that the size of

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,660
 the max-flow is the most to the capacity of the min st-cut.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,065
 And to do that,

4
00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:12,930
 we need to show that for any particular flow f and any particular st-cut L,R,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,300
 the size of this flow is at most the capacity of this cut.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,970
 Let's take a look again at our earlier example of a flow network.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,085
 And here is our example of an st-cut.

8
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,910
 These four vertices are set L and the other four vertices are

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,050
 the set R. Now the capacity of this cut is 27.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,610
 That's the total capacity of the edges going from L to R. Now the intuition for

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,930
 this claim is that this flow is going from s to t. At some point,

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,540
 it has to exit from L to R. These six edges which go from

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,115
 L to R are the only edges that the flow can escape L from.

14
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:54,620
 Now the total capacity of these edges is 27.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,620
 So the total amount of flow that can go along these edges is at most 27.

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,900
 So the size of this flow has to be at most 27. That's the intuition.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,680
 Let's formalize it. To formalize the intuition we just stated,

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,780
 we're going to prove the following claim.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,745
 We're going to prove that the size of this flow equals the total flow out of the set L,

20
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:19,500
 minus the total flow into the set L. Now it will just be a few lines to prove this claim.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,110
 It's quite easy. And then once we have this claim,

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,840
 the main statement that the size of f is at most of

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,285
 capacity of this cut will follow immediately.

24
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:30,485
 And this claim is going to be useful later.

25
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:33,300
 We're going to use it when we prove the reverse inequality,

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,300
 that the max flow is at least the min st- cut capacity.
