1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,845
 In this graph, there are five strongly connected components.

2
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:04,500
 Let's go ahead and mark them.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,345
 An easy one to notice is A by itself.

4
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:08,840
 Notice that from vertex A,

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,270
 I can reach many other vertices but no other vertices can reach A,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,285
 so A is not strongly connected to any other vertices,

7
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:19,290
 therefore A is a strongly connected component by itself.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,315
 These five vertices form a strongly connected component.

9
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:27,105
 Notice that all five vertices are strongly connected with each other, in particular,

10
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,180
 from vertex J, I can reach all of

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,105
 the other vertices and all the other vertices can reach vertex A via I.

12
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:38,155
 Similarly, these three vertices form a strongly connected component.

13
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:42,360
 These two vertices B and E form a strongly connected component and D is

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,070
 by itself because other vertices can reach D but D can't reach anybody else.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,479
 So I have these five strongly connected components,

16
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,650
 A by itself, B and E, C, F,

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,590
 G, D by itself and then H,

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,302
 I, J, K, L are together.

19
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:00,180
 I want to point out some interesting properties of

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,493
 strongly connected components so I want to look at this graph on five vertices.

21
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:07,945
 I'm going to make a meta vertex for each strongly connected component.

22
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,365
 So when I have a meta vertex for A by itself,

23
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,080
 B and E together C, F, G,

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,765
 D and H through L. So I'm going to think of

25
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:19,770
 compressing each of these purple blobs into a vertex,

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,530
 a meta vertex and then there's going to be an edge from

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,020
 this meta vertex to this meta vertex because there is an edge from some vertex in C, F,

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,500
 G to some vertex in this strongly connected component namely from F to I

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,670
 and similarly there will be an edge between

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,665
 these meta vertices and these meta vertices and so on.

31
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:42,600
 So when we look at this graph on the meta vertices

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 of strongly connected components we're going to see some interesting properties.
