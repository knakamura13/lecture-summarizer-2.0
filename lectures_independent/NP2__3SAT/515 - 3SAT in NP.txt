Now to prove that 3SAT is in the class ϵNP, we have to show that we can verify solutions efficiently. So, let's take a particular input for the 3SAT problem. So f is our input for the 3SAT problem. And let's take a proposed solution. So this is a true false assignment for the n variables. Now we need to check that this assignment is a satisfying assignment for this formula. Now, how are we going to verify that this assignment is a satisfying assignment? Well, we're going to go through the clauses. So let's take each clause. For a particular clause C, you will take us order one time to check that at least one of the literals in C is satisfied. Why is it order one time? Because each clause has at most three literals. Now if every clause C is satisfied, then the formula f is satisfied. It takes order one time per clause, there's M clauses, so it takes order M total time to verify that this assignment satisfies the formula. So this proves that the 3SAT problem is in the class ϵNP.
