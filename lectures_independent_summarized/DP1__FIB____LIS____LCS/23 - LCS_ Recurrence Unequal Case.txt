Developing a recurrence relation for finding the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two sequences, X and Y, with lengths I and J, respectively. Different lengths of X and Y are considered. When the last characters, X_i and Y_j, differ, LCS could end with either one of these characters or with neither. The LCS length, denoted as L(i,j), then has two scenarios: 1. If last character of X isn't included, L(i,j) = L(i-1,j), indicating the LCS without last char of X. 2. If last character of Y isn't included, L(i,j) = L(i,j-1), indicating the LCS without last char of Y. Select the greater length between these two scenarios for the optimal solution. This provides the recurrence relation for differing characters: L(i,j) = max(L(i-1,j), L(i,j-1)). This rule applies when the compared characters at the ends of the sequences do not match, providing a method for constructing the length of the LCS iteratively by comparing prefixes of increasing length.
