Translated primal LP with 3 variables and 4 constraints into a dual LP with 4 variables (y1, y2, y3, y4). Goal: minimize 300y1 + 200y2 + 1000y3 + 500y4 reflecting constraint values. Constraints: y1 + y3 ≥ 1, y2 + 3y3 + y4 ≥ 6, 2y3 + 3y4 ≥ 10; y's must be non-negative. Feasible x sets lower profit bound; feasible y sets upper profit bound in primal LP. Dual LP provides complement to primal, with each offering bounds on achievable profit.
