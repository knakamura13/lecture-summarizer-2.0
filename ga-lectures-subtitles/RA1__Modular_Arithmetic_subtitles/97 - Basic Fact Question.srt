00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,935
 Here's a basic fact that we're going to use repeatedly throughout our work.

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:05,610
 Let's say I have two numbers, x and y,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,180
 which are congruent mod N. And I have two additional numbers, a and b,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,880
 which are also congruent mod N. Now, the point is,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,815
 that with respect to mod N,

6
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:17,215
 x and y are equivalent and a and b are equivalent.

7
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:18,885
 So, I can replace one by the other.

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:23,385
 More precisely, suppose I'm looking at x plus a mod N. Well,

9
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:24,840
 x is equivalent to y,

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,535
 so I can replace x by y,

11
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:28,125
 and a is equivalent by b,

12
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,060
 so, I can replace a by b.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,880
 So, x plus a mod N,

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,020
 is congruent to y plus b mod N. I can replace x by y and a by b.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,120
 Similarly, if I look at x times a mod N,

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,035
 instead of adding or multiplying,

17
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:45,100
 then I can do the same replacement operation.

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,160
 So x times a mod N,

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,160
 is congruent to y times b mod N. Now let's

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,160
 look at an example to illustrate the usefulness of this basic
