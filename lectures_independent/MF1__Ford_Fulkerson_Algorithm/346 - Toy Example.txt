Now it'll be useful to have a small toy example to work with when we devise our algorithms. So let's look at this following example. It only has four vertices. It's quite easy to find a max flow in this network. Here's a max flow in this network. Notice this flow is of size 17. Therefore it's clearly maximum because it achieves the capacity into t and also the capacity out of s. Now we're going to use this toy example as a running example to try out our right.
