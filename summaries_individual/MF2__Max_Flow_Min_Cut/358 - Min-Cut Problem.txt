Cuts in graphs partition vertices into two sets, labeled L (left) and R (right). St-cuts specifically separate vertices S (in L) and T (in R). Example: vertices S, A, B, F form L, with no requirement for connectivity within the set, and C, D, E, T comprise R. Capacity of an st-cut concerns directed edges from L to R, calculating the sum of capacities of these edges, ignoring edges from R to L. Edges like C to F, entering L, are excluded from this calculation.
