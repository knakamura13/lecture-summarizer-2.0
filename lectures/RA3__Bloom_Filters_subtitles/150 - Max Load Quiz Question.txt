Now what we saw in the last slide was that the probability that a particular bin Bi gets load at least log n is at most, one_over_n_squared. Now, can we use that to bound the max load? Can we upper bound the probability that the max load is at least log n? Why don't you go ahead and write this quantity here. If you have trouble doing it, don't worry, we'll go through it in a minute.
