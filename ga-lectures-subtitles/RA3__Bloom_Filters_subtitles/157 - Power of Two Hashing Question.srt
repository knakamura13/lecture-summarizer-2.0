1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
 what we're gonna do now is instead of

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,570
 using a single hash function we're going

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,850
 to choose a pair of hash functions H 1

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,639
 and H 2 each of these hash tables Maps

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,309
 elements of U of our possible passwords

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,179
 into our hash table of size n now we're

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,440
 assume that these hash functions are

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,020
 random so each element acts in the

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,320
 universe of possible passwords maps to a

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,050
 random element of the hash table H 1 of

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,449
 X is random in each two of X are random

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,099
 and these are independent of each other

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,109
 and independent of the other hash values

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,660
 the first question is how do we insert

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,480
 an element a possible password into our

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,090
 dictionary of unacceptable passwords in

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,070
 the traditional scheme this is quite

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,840
 straightforward what we do is we look at

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,510
 our hash function and we look at H of X

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,480
 that tells us the hash value and now we

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,430
 looked at the linked list at H of X and

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,530
 we add element acts onto that linked

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,809
 list but now we have two hash functions

24
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,300
 H 1 and H 2 so how do we do this

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,820
 insertion into our dictionary in this

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,800
 scenario when we have two hash functions

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,750
 this is a bit of an open-ended question

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,100
 but why don't you think about how you

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,200
 would insert an element into our

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 dictionary using two hash functions
