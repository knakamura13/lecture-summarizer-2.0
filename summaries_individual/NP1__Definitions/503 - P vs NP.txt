P vs NP relates to problem-solving within computer science, where NP encompasses all search problems and P includes only those solvable in polynomial time, implying P is a subset of NP. Problems like the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) are in both P and NP, as are Knapsack, Satisfiability, and Coloring problems. The key unresolved question is whether problems exist in NP that are not in P, which would mean P â‰  NP. If all NP problems are also found in P, then it would imply P = NP, suggesting all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time, but this is not yet determined.
