Identifying a gap in available capacities graph concerning the optimal flow solution. Necessary to consider the reverse path b-to-a for flow augmentation, as it's not represented in the initial graph. Conceptualize flow as a faucet; increasing flow a-to-b opens it, while b-to-a closes it, reducing flow a-to-b. Adding this reverse path with capacity equal to the existing flow (10 units) from a-to-b allows for such adjustment. This introduces the concept of the residual network, which accurately reflects all possible flow adjustments, unlike the available capacities graph. By utilizing the residual network, a path from s-to-t can be found with a capacity for 7-unit augmentation, thus altering flows from s-to-b to 7 units, reducing a-to-b from 10 to 3 units, and increasing a-to-t by 7 units to reach max flow in the example. Essential to focus on the residual network to effectively identify and implement optimal flow adjustments.
