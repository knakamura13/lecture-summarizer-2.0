Proven that flow F's size equals the outflow from L minus inflow to L, for any flow and ST cut. Size of F ≤ capacity of ST cut (L, R), indicating max flow ≤ min ST cut cap. This follows because the outflow from L must be ≤ the sum of edge capacities between L and R. Example: ST cut cap is 27; thus, outflow from L ≤ 27, proving max flow size ≤ min ST cut capacity. Next step: show max flow size ≥ min ST cut capacity to complete the theorem proof.
