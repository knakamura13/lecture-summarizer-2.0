Defined a subproblem D(i,z) in dynamic programming to compute the shortest path from a source vertex s to a vertex z using at most i edges in a graph. Established the base case where D(0,s) = 0, as no edges are used, and any path to another vertex is infinitely long. Developed a recurrence that calculates D(i,z) by trying all predecessors y of z, and choosing the one that, when added to the edge weight W(y,z), minimizes the path length from s to z using i edges. Acknowledged that using exactly i edges might not yield the overall shortest path, as fewer may suffice. Therefore, adjusted the recurrence to minimize over paths using at most i edges, combining the best solution found with exactly i edges and the best found using fewer, i.e., min(D(i-1,y) + W(y,z), D(i-1,z)). This accounts for the possibility of shorter paths that do not utilize all available edges.
