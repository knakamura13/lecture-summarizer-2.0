00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,775
 Let's go back and have a somewhat philosophical discussion on the P verses NP question.

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:10,080
 Recall that NP stands for the class of all search problems.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,240
 Meanwhile, P is the class of those search problems that can be solved in polynomial time.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,560
 So, every search problem lies in NP and

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,580
 P are those search problems which can also be solved in polynomial time.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,035
 So P has an extra restriction.

7
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:28,860
 So P is a subset of NP.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,415
 So if we look at it graphically,

9
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,655
 we have this class of problems in P,

10
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:36,720
 and then we have this class NP which is a superset of P. Now,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,220
 we have some examples of problems which lie in P. For example,

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,385
 the MST problem that lies in P and it lies in NP.

13
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:48,439
 We just saw that the search version of knapsack problem lies in NP.

14
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,640
 We saw that the satisfiability problem lies in NP.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,730
 We saw that the colorings problems lies in NP.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,640
 Now, is there a separation here?

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,045
 Are there problems which lie in NP but do not lie in P?

18
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,040
 We don't know whether that's the case.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,760
 It may be that all these problems in this band actually

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,580
 lie in P. That these two classes are the same.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,450
 P equals NP or may be the case that there are problems which

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,025
 lie in NP which do not lie in P. That means that P is not equal to NP,

23
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:17,025
 and there are some problems that we can not solve in polynomial time.
