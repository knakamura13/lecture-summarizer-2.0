Identifying nth roots of unity in complex plane; represent number 1 in polar as (1, multiple of 2pi * j for any integer j). For complex number Z in polar form as (r, theta), when raised to n, demands r^n=1 (all roots lie on unit circle of radius 1). Theta determined by equation n*theta = 2pi*j, solve for theta results in theta = 2pi*j/n. Example with n=8 yields 8 distinct root positions on unit circle at incremental angles of 2pi/8 (or pi/4), starting at 1 (0 degrees) up to 7pi/4, then repeating at 2pi.
