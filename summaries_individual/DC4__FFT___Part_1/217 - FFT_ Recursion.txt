Polynomial A of X is decomposed into A even and A odd such that A(x) = A even(x^2) + x*A odd(x^2). When evaluating A at points XI and -XI (with the plus-minus property), A(XI) and A(-XI) both depend on A even and A odd at XI^2 but differ by the XI coefficient in front of A odd. With Y1...YN as the squares of XI...XN, A can be evaluated at XI and -XI in constant time, as long as A even and A odd are known at these squared points. Essentially, the evaluation of polynomial A at endpoint pairs with the plus-minus property is efficient, needing only the values of A even and A odd at the squares of the endpoints.
