00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 In this section, we'll explore linear programming.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,410
 This is a powerful technique.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,804
 We'll see how to solve a variety of problems using linear programming.

4
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:11,304
 We'll start by seeing how we solve max flow using linear programming,

5
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:15,640
 then we'll see a few simple examples of linear programs for production problems.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,000
 After looking at these examples,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,454
 we'll give the general formulation of linear programming,

8
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,929
 and look at the standard form for LPs.

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:23,894
 Finally, we'll look at LP duality,

10
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,730
 which is a beautiful and important aspect of this topic.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:26,730
 Let's dive in and look at how we express max flow as a linear program.
