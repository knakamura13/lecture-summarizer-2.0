1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,355
 Now one last point about the cut property.

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:04,615
 There's another algorithm,

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:07,190
 Prim's algorithm. Prim's algorithm is for Minimum Spanning Tree problem.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,600
 And is very similar to Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,025
 Now to make sure you understand the cut property,

6
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:17,460
 you should use it to prove correctness of Prim's algorithm.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,505
 Make sure you understand why Prim's algorithm is correct,

8
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:20,505
 by using the cut property.
