The problem addresses finding the substring (contiguous subsequence) with the maximum sum within a sequence of numbers a_1 through a_n. To solve this, it is essential to define a subproblem with the prefix of length i and establish a function, s(i), representing the maximum sum obtainable from a substring within this prefix. A recursive relationship is sought to express s(i) in terms of previous subproblems (s(1) to s(i-1)). The challenge arises in determining whether to include the number a_i in the optimal subsequence sum s(i-1), which depends on whether the subsequence includes a_(i-1) to maintain contiguity. This difficulty implies that the current subproblem definition is inadequate, as it doesn't provide information about the endpoint of the subsequence. Hence, a refinement of the definition is necessary to account for the endpoint, ensuring that s(i) can be expressed in terms of smaller subproblems while preserving the requirement of contiguity.
