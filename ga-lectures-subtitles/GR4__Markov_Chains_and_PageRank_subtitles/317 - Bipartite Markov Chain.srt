00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,805
 Now here's an example of a Markov chain whose graph corresponds to a bipartite graph.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,680
 Let's look at some basic properties of this Markov chain.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,130
 Suppose we start our random walk from one of these vertices on the left side,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,930
 either state one, three,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,330
 or five. What do we know?

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,564
 We know at time one we're on the right side,

7
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:18,720
 and actually at any odd time we're on

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,490
 the right side and at any even time we're on the left side.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,768
 Now suppose we start on the right side,

10
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:28,790
 so at times zero we're at either vertex two or vertex four.

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,535
 Now we have the opposite situation,

12
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,738
 at odd times where on the left side,

13
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:35,545
 at even times we're guaranteed to be on the right side.

14
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:39,075
 So the punch line is that the starting state matters in this graph.

15
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:43,110
 Whenever we have a bipartite graph the starting state matters.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,045
 Now we want a simple way to ensure that our Markov chain is not bipartite,

17
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:51,325
 and even more so we want to ensure that the Markov chain has no periodic structure.

18
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:52,680
 Instead of being bipartite,

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,980
 having these cycles of period two we could have cycles a period three.

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,980
 So in general, if we want to ensure that the graph has

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,410
 no periodic structure, that is aperiodic.

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,540
 Well what's an easy way to ensure that?

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,795
 An easy way is to have a self loop on each vertex.

24
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:10,260
 So with some probability we stay where we are.

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,560
 This can be a very small, miniscule probability.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,695
 So let's say with probability point 01 we stay where we are,

27
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:20,700
 and then we can rescale the other probabilities so that they sum up to one.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,758
 In terms of their transition matrix,

29
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:24,895
 this means that our diagonals,

30
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:29,130
 the self loops are out diagonal entries in this transition matrix.

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,350
 We want all of these diagonal entries to be strictly greater than zero.

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,835
 So we want the diagonal entries to be positive.

33
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:39,145
 If they're positive, that destroys any periodic structure.

34
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:41,965
 It can't be bipartite or any periodic structure.

35
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:45,030
 So for every state i, we'll make sure that the probability of going from

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,810
 state i and staying in state i is strictly greater than zero.

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:48,810
 Okay that gets around this pitfall.
