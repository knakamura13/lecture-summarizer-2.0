Now that you've seen your first NP completeness proof, the fact that three SAT is NP complete. There are a few relevant practice problems from the text book that you can try now. In problem 8.3, they consider a variant of SAT, called stingy SAT, and you want to prove that stingy SAT is NP complete. In problem 8.8, you consider exact 4-SAT. This means that every class has exactly four literals, not at most four literals but exactly four literals in every class. And you want to prove that exact 4-SAT is
