00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
 Let's take a look at a simple example of a linear program.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,415
 This is motivated by a basic production problem.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:07,365
 Consider a company that makes two products,

4
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:08,925
 let's call them A and B.

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,009
 We want to figure out how many of each product

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,589
 to produce in order to maximize our profit.

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,554
 Now let's make some modeling assumptions.

8
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:20,324
 Each unit of A that we sell makes a profit of one dollar and for each unit of B,

9
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:23,100
 we'll assume that it makes a profit of six dollars.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,125
 Now let's make some assumptions about the demand for each product.

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,350
 We'll assume that the demand for A is

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,825
 at most 300 units per day and at most 200 units per day for B.

13
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,509
 We'll also assumes some supply constraints.

14
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:38,850
 We'll assume our employees can work at most 700 hours per

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,615
 day and each unit of A that we produce takes one hour,

16
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:45,780
 whereas each unit of B takes three hours.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:45,780
 Now let's express this is as a linear.
