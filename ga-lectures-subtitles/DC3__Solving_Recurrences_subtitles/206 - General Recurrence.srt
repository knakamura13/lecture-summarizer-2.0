1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 Now, let's look at the more general form of recurrences.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,805
 So for positive constants a and b greater than one.

3
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:12,870
 Let's look at the recurrence T(n) = a T(n/b) + O(n).

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,880
 Our previous two examples had b=2,

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,615
 and we did a case where a=4, and a=3.

6
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:25,911
 Now, the recurrence for the median finding algorithm has a = 1 and has b = 4/3.

7
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:30,160
 And merge sort has a = 2 and b = 2.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,536
 Now, when you expand this out you get c*n from this O(n),

9
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,505
 times the following quantity,

10
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,960
 1+ (a/b) + (a /bÂ²).

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,030
 And so on up to a/b.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,205
 And then, it's going to stop when we get the logb(n).

13
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,815
 In the last term is going to be a,

14
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:52,320
 ^logb(n)/T(1 ), which is O(1).

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,195
 Now, the key is what happens for this geometric series?

16
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:58,110
 It depends on whether a/b > 1,

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,790
 = 1, or < 1.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,785
 If a is bigger than b,

19
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:05,690
 then we get an increasing geometric series and the last term dominates.

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,170
 If a = b,

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,770
 then we get a geometric series where I term is one.

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,690
 If a < b, then we get a decreasing geometric series and the first term dominates.

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,570
 Let's do the easy case first,

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,485
 a < b, so the first term dominates.

25
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,625
 So this geometric series is on the O(1).

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,950
 So we get O(1) for this geometric series,

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,620
 get O(n) here, so the whole thing is going to be O(n),

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,515
 so we get O(n), in this case.

29
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,510
 What happens when a = b?

30
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,685
 Then each of these terms is one.

31
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,410
 So we get log n terms.

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,050
 So the geometric series is on the order of log n,

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,910
 so we have O(n) times O(logn).

34
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,250
 So that's going to be O(n) logn.

35
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,468
 So in the case, a = b, we get O(n),

36
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:50,040
 log n that's for merge sort.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,030
 Finally, what happens in the case when a > b?

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,930
 Now, the last term dominates.

39
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,315
 Notice the denominator here is b ^logb(n) which is n,

40
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:04,200
 so this term, cancels this term.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,375
 So the whole thing is on the order of a ^logb(n).

42
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,683
 Converting that into a polynomial,

43
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:19,020
 we get that this recurrence in the case a > b is on the order of n, ^logb(a).

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,910
 And of course, one can look at more general forms of recurrences where here,

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,350
 we have instead of O(n),

46
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,110
 we have O(n) ^d,

47
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,100
 where d is a constant.

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,570
 This is commonly referred to as the master theorem and you can look at

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:32,570
 your textbook for the form of the master theorem and the solution to the master theorem.
