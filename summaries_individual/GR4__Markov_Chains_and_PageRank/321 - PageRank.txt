The Page Rank algorithm, created by Brin and Page in 1998, is designed to determine the importance of web pages without the need for understanding Markov chains. Importance in this context is subjective and requires quantification by the algorithm itself. Earlier search engines of the mid-90s would search their database for pages containing a specific query term and then rank these pages by relevance. However, these systems could easily be manipulated by inserting common query terms into web pages, creating a need for a better ranking method. Page Rank resolves this by sorting and prioritizing web pages based on their established importance, thereby presenting the most significant pages first in search results. For instance, when searching for a term like "Markov chains," a recognized news outlet like CNN featuring an article on the subject would be considered more important and therefore ranked higher than individual lecture notes on the same topic. The Page Rank algorithm offers a more sophisticated approach to rank web pages, taking into account their relative significance to provide more relevant search results.
