General k-sized clauses labeled a1 to ak generate k-3 new vars Y1 to Yk-3, distinct for each clause, yielding n*m potential new vars across m clauses. Original clause C replaced by k-2 clauses; pattern starts with a1, a2, Y1, and alternates negations of newly introduced Y vars with subsequent a literals. Last clause differs, ending with ak-1, ak. This forms C_prime formula. Claim: original clause C's satisfiability equates to C_prime's satisfiability, allowing transformation of any clause >3 literals into 3-literal clauses, preserving satisfiability, critical for reducing to a three SAT problem. Proof of claim required to verify reduction validity.
