1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
 Now let's take a look at the following recurrence,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,460
 T(n) = 3T(n/2) + O(n).

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,010
 This is the recurrence which arised in

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,315
 the more sophisticated integer multiplication algorithm.

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:15,540
 Just as before, rewriting this to eliminate the big O notation,

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,920
 we have T(n) is at most cn for this term plus 3T(n/2) for that term.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,740
 Now substituting in as we did before and

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,265
 repeating it i - 1 times we get the following recurrence,

9
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,551
 T(n) is at most cn(1 + (3/2) + (3/2)^2 + and so on up to

10
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:43,620
 (3/2)^i-1) + 3^iT(n/2^i).

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,040
 Notice that before we had a geometric series with base (4/2)

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,150
 and now we have a geometric series with base (3/2).

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,790
 And instead of 4^i we get 3^i,

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,825
 this is because we replaced four with three here.

15
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,490
 Now once again we're going to stop when we get to

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,495
 the base cases which is when this is one.

17
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:07,770
 So we're going to stop when i = log2 of n. Why is it the base two?

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,555
 Because we have two to the eye here.

19
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:14,040
 So if we would have had subproblems of size n/3 then we would stop when we have

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,145
 log3 n. Now plugging this in we get the following expression,

21
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,750
 so we have T(n) is at most cn(1 + (3/2) so on up to

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:33,660
 (3/2)^log2 n-1) + 3^log2 n T(1).

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,070
 T(1) is at most c, cn is O(n).

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,500
 What about this geometric series?

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,310
 Well the base is (3/2).

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,265
 So it's an increasing geometric series,

27
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:46,015
 the last term dominates.

28
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,670
 We can forget about the minus one,

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,050
 that's just an extra factor of two thirds.

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,090
 So this is 0((3/2)^log2 n),

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,240
 the numerator is 3^log2 n,

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:05,730
 the denominator is 2^log2 n. 2^log2 n is n so that cancels with this n,

33
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,020
 this O(n) cancels with this one over order n. So we get O(1)

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,800
 (O(3^log2n) and this term is also O(3^log2 n).

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,755
 That's not a coincidence.

36
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,578
 This should be the last term of this geometric series,

37
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:25,170
 so they should be on the same order of magnitude.

38
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,010
 Finally we want to manipulate this into a polynomial and we

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,010
 just saw that this is on the O(n^log2 3).
