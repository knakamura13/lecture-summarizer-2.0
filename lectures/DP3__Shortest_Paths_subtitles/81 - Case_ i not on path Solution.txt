If for text i is not on the path P, then this path P only uses a subset of vertices one through i minus one, as intermediate vertices. Therefore, D of i, s, t in this case is the same as D of i minus 1, s, t. Since we're only using a subset of the first i minus one vertices intermediate vertices. The solution is obtained by this subproblem. The other case is when i is on this path. Let's dive into this a little bit more carefully.
