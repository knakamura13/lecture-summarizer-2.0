00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Now, to write a recurrence for D of i, s, t,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 we want to use D of i minus one for some pair s and t,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,535
 which might be different vertices.

4
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:13,980
 But the key thing is that we want to change this parameter i to i minus one.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,080
 So how do we get that? Look at this path.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,950
 This is a path from s to i which only uses

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,170
 a subset of the first i minus one vertices as intermediate vertices.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,915
 So, that is D of i minus one s, i.

9
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:29,940
 That's a smaller subproblem which we've already

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,030
 solved in our dynamic programming algorithm.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,140
 Similarly, this portion of the path is the shortest path from i to

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,260
 t which uses a subset of the first i minus one vertices as intermediate vertices.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,740
 This is D of i minus one because the

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,370
 first i minus one vertices only are intermediate vertices

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,850
 on the path and it's starting at i and it's ending at t. So

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,800
 the total length of this path is the sum of these two terms.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,030
 So now we have a recurrence with D of i, s,

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,630
 t. It's D of i minus one, s,

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,350
 i that gives us the shortest path from s to i using a subset

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,300
 of the first i minus one as intermediate vertices plus D of i minus one,

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,780
 i, t that gives us the path from i to t using

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,940
 this subset of one through i minus one as intermediate vertices on the path.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,560
 So we have a recurrence for D of i, s,

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
 t in the case when i is in

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,935
 the path and we have the recurrence for the case when i is not in the path.

26
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:28,935
 What do we do? We take the best of those two sce-
