Euclid's algorithm is based on a fundamental principle, often referred to as Euclid's rule, that asserts the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers X and Y (X â‰¥ Y > 0) is the same as the GCD of X mod Y and Y. The proof of this rule hinges on the reasoning that any divisor of X and Y must also divide X minus Y and Y, and vice versa. This is due to the fact that if a number D divides both X and Y, it naturally divides their difference (X minus Y). The converse holds true as well because if D divides X minus Y and Y, it also divides X, which is the sum of X minus Y and Y. By this logic, the common divisors of X and Y are the same as those of X mod Y and Y, leading to the same greatest common divisor. Euclid's algorithm employs this iterative process of reducing X by modulating it with Y until the remainder is less than Y, effectively applying the GCD logic recursively until the result is reached.
