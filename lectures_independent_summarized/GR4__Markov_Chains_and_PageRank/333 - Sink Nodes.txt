The random surfer model has a problem with sink nodes—pages without outgoing links—making the model undefined for these cases. Three fixes are proposed. First, a self-loop keeps the surfer on the same page, which inflates that page's rank artificially. Second, recursively removing sink nodes risks shrinking the graph and some pages never receiving a rank. Lastly, the preferred solution is directing the surfer to a random web page from the entire graph when landing on a sink node, effectively setting the choice probability (alpha) to zero for these cases. This method aligns with PageRank's solution as per Wikipedia.
