1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
 Now let's formalize what we've just said.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,300
 If for some i, xi the positive literal

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,350
 and the negative literal xi bar are both in the same SCC,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,310
 so these two literals are strongly connected with each other,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,040
 then the formula is not satisfiable.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,540
 We just solved why this is true,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,865
 because if we set xi to be true,

8
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:25,070
 then we get a contradiction because we have to set xi to be false.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,861
 And if we set xi to be false,

10
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:30,990
 then we get a contradiction because that leads to xi being true.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,525
 Now suppose this is not the case, for every i,

12
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,965
 xi and xi bar are in different SCCs.

13
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:39,835
 Now in this case f is satisfiable.

14
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:45,105
 So for every i, xi and xi bar are in different strongly connected components,

15
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:47,325
 then f is satisfiable.

16
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,525
 We'll prove this part by finding a satisfying assignment.

17
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:56,915
 So this statement that if xi and xi bar are in the same SCC then f is not satisfiable.

18
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,740
 We already discussed why that's true.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,175
 For this one, where for every i,

20
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:04,945
 xi and xi bar are in different strongly connected components we're

21
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:09,435
 going to prove that f is satisfiable by finding a satisfying assignment.

22
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,030
 So we're going to construct an algorithm which is

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,610
 going to find a satisfying assignment and therefore we're

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,770
 going to prove that f is satisfiable by actually

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,370
 satisfying this f. Let's go ahead and construct the algorithm.

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,485
 So we're going to assume that for every i,

27
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:26,445
 xi and xi bar are in different strongly connected components.

28
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:26,445
 And we're going to use that fact to construct a satisfying assignment for f.
