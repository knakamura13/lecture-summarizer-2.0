This motivates the notion of variable edges. If I had an edge from this vertex corresponding to X_1 to this vertex corresponding to X_1-bar, then I ensure that any independent set contains this vertex or this vertex or neither, but it cannot contain both vertices. And therefore, I'll never try to set X_1 to be true and X_1 to be false. In general, for each of the variables X_i, I'm going to add edges between all copies corresponding to X_i and all copies corresponding to X_i-bar. This will ensure that our independent set corresponds to a valid assignment and then the clause edges will ensure that our independent set corresponds to an assignment which satisfies all of the clauses. Let's take a look at a specific example to illustrate this construction.
