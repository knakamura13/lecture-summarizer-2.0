Analysing the performance of a random algorithm solving a linear program (LP) that employs randomized rounding to satisfy clauses. Capital W represents the total number of satisfied clauses, a random variable with its expectation being a focus of investigation. For individual clause J, WJ equals 1 if satisfied (0 if not). The overall expected number of satisfied clauses, E[W], can be expressed as the sum of the expectations of individual clauses E[WJ], which equates to their probability of satisfaction. Proving a lemma shows each clause CJ's satisfaction probability is at least 1 - 1/e times its LP value, ZJ hat star. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that E[W] is at least one minus 1 over E times the optimum for integer LP (M star). Thus, we achieve a 1 - 1/e approximation ratio, surpassing the previous one-half approximation. The key step is proving the lemma, after which this result defines the algorithm's performance.
