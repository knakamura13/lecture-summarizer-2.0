Feasible region illus. demonstrates non-existence due to non-negative constraints (x, y ≥ 0). Constraint 1 (x + y ≤ 1) and constraint 2 (3x + 2y ≥ 6) yield non-intersecting half spaces. Resulting feasible region is therefore empty, making the LP (linear program) undefined. Infeasibility is independent of LP's objective function; LP remains infeasible for any objective function given these constraints.
