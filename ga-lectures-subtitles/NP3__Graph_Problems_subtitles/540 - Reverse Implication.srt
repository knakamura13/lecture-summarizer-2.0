1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,585
 Now let's look at the reverse implication.

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:07,680
 Now since this independent set has size at least G and G is set to M,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,000
 then we know that this independent set has exactly one vertex in each of the clauses,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,590
 actually in each of the triangles corresponding to the clauses.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,350
 Now this vertex corresponds to a literal in the original formula.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,800
 So we set that corresponding literal to true.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,210
 So we satisfy that literal,

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,030
 since every clause has a satisfied literal then we know

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,225
 every clause is satisfied and therefore the formula is satisfied.

10
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:33,750
 But does this correspond to an assignment, a valid assignment?

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,135
 But notice we have no contradictory literals in this set.

12
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:41,370
 Why? Because we added edges between Xi and Xi bar so we can never

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,190
 including vertex Xi and a vertex Xi bar in an independent set.

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,120
 Therefore, we never attempt to set Xi to true and Xi to false.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,360
 So this assignment we constructed corresponds to a valid assignment.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,450
 This is a valid assignment and it says every clause.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,450
 Therefore, it satisfies the formula F,

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,890
 so we've taken an independent set of size at

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,680
 least G and we construct a satisfying assignment.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,220
 This completes the proof of the reverse implication.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,110
 So we've shown this equivalence.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,750
 This proves that a reduction from 3SAT to independent set is

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
 correct and it shows how to take

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,925
 an independent set and construct a satisfying assignment.

25
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,060
 And if there is no independent set of size at least

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,670
 G then there is no satisfying assignment.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,670
 So this completes the proof that the Independent set problem is NP-complete.
