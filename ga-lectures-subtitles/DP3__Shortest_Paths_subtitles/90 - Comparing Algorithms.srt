00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
 Let me modify this example slightly.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,100
 I've taken the example from the last slide and I would just flip

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,740
 this one edge from d to b,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,830
 it used to be, and now goes from b to d. And,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,625
 I want to compare the two algorithms we have for detecting negative weight cycles.

6
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,722
 First algorithm is Bellman-Ford.

7
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:19,080
 The second algorithm we have is Floyd-Warshall.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,895
 Floyd-Warshall does all pair shortest path.

9
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:24,965
 Bellman-Ford does single source shortest path.

10
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:27,000
 So, we give it a start vertex and it finds

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,240
 the shortest path from that started vertex to all other vertices.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,590
 Now, in this example,

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,050
 suppose we run Bellman-Ford with

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,305
 the start vertex as d. It's not going to do much interesting because from d,

15
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,220
 you can't even reach any end of the graph.

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,600
 But, is it going to find this negative weight cycle, a, b, c?

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,415
 It's not going to find it because that cycle is not reachable from the start vertex.

18
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:56,025
 So Bellman-Ford only finds negative weight cycles reachable from the start vertex.

19
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,200
 It can't find this cycle because it's not

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,735
 reachable from the start vertex d, in this case.

21
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:06,945
 If we had run Bellman-Ford from a or b or c or even e,

22
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:09,070
 then we would have found this negative weight cycle.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,500
 So Bellman-Ford finds negative weight cycles which are reachable from the start vertex,

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,330
 whereas Floyd-Warshall will find

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,740
 a negative weight cycle anywhere in the graph because it's doing all pairs,

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:18,740
 so it's finding everything in the graph.
