Constraint requirements for clauses in a logical setting established. Using clause titled "X5 or X3 or X6" as an illustration, a scenario outlined where assigning false to variables (X5, X3, X6) equates to setting corresponding variables (Y5, Y3, Y6) to 0. If all Y variables are 0, indicating the clause is not satisfied, an associated variable ZJ must also be 0. To enforce this, it is proposed that ZJ should be no greater than the sum of Y5, Y3, Y6, ensuring ZJ is 0 if all Ys are 0. If one or more Y variables are 1, ZJ can be 0 or 1. ZJs are to be maximized as part of the objective function, which will ideally take the value of 1 if possible, indicating clause satisfaction. The constraints ensure all variables (Ys and ZJs) range only between 0 and 1.
