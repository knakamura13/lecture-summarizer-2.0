00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
 Let's take a look at the arithmetic mean,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,275
 geometric mean and inequality.

3
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:06,120
 Let's take a look at its general form.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,370
 We have K non-negative numbers, W1 through WK.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,010
 Think of these as weights.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,175
 We want to look at the mean of these weights.

7
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:17,155
 So we can look at the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean.

8
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:21,715
 The arithmetic mean takes the sum and divides by the number of terms.

9
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:25,380
 The geometric mean takes the product and takes the K through.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,895
 How do these two things relate?

11
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:31,065
 While the arithmetic mean is always at least the geometric mean.

12
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,630
 And this holds for any non-negative weights.

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,620
 How do we relate this to our problem?

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,215
 Well, we're going to set WI to be one minus YI star hat.

15
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:44,610
 And then the arithmetic mean is one over K times the sum

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,755
 of one minus Yi hat star And this is at least the geometric mean,

17
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:52,668
 which is the product over I of

18
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:57,970
 one minus YI hat star and then we take the K through of the right hand side.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,990
 Now, alternatively, instead of taking the K through to the right hand side,

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,370
 we can take the Kth power of both sides and we have the following inequality.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:05,370
 This is the one we're going to use.
