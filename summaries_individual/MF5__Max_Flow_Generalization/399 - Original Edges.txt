Edges from original flow network G are retained in new network G'. Capacities are modified to reflect both original capacities and demands, ensuring non-negative flow exists if and only if flow â‰¥ demand in G. New network flows must meet transformed capacity constraints, analogous to G's. A zero flow in G' represents a flow of d (demand) in G, requiring a capacity shift by d units in G'. Example: an edge originally with capacity 10, after accounting for 3 units of demand, now has a reduced capacity of 7 in G'. Other edges similarly adjusted to capacities of 1 and 4, reflecting original capacities minus respective demands.
