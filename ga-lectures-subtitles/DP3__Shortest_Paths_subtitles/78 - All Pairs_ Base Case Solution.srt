00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
 As in the Bellman-Ford algorithm,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,055
 the base case is the situation when i equals zero.

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,845
 That's when we have the empty set as possible intermediate vertices.

4
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:08,845
 So we have to go directly from s to t without any intermediate vertices allowed.
