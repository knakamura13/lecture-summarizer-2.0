1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,215
 Let's look at the solution to our earlier quiz before detailing the dual LP.

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:08,490
 Since the primal LP has three variables, x1, x2, x3,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,105
 the dual LP has a constraint for each variable in the primal LP.

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:15,800
 So, there are three constraints in the dual LP.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,480
 And since the primal LP has two constraints,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,660
 the dual LP has a variable for each constraint.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,030
 So there are two variables in the dual LP.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,735
 Let's denote these variables as y1 and y2.

9
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:31,760
 Now, since the primal LP is maximizing, in the dual LP,

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,645
 we're trying to find the smallest possible upper bound.

11
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,195
 So we have a minimization problem.

12
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:42,720
 Now the objective function is going to be a linear function of y1 and y2.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,075
 The question is, what are the coefficients of this objective function?

14
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:49,715
 Let's denote these coefficients as d1 and d2,

15
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:53,440
 and we're trying to find this vector d. Now there are three constraints.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,740
 Each one is a linear function of y1 and y2.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,770
 And let's denote the left-hand side,

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,370
 the coefficients of the left-hand side of the constraints by matrix

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,540
 e. So for the first constraint this will be e1 1 and this will be e1 2.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,780
 Second constraint will be e 2 1 times y1 plus e2 2 times y2.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,965
 And for the third constraint we'll have e3 1 and e3 2.

22
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,905
 Now in the dual LP, in standard form,

23
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:21,890
 these constraints will all be at least constraints,

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,220
 and let's denote the right-hand side of these constraints by the vector

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,760
 f. So this will be f1, f2, and f3.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,705
 And the next quiz is to detail this dual LP.

27
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:37,680
 To do that we need to specify this vector d, d1 and d2.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,850
 We need to specify this matrix e. And finally,

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,280
 we need to specify the right-hand sides of the constraints,

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,040
 which is the vector f. And, of course,

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,125
 there are also the non-negative constraints,

32
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,200
 y1 and y2 are at least zero.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,195
 So why don't you go ahead and specify this vector, and this vector,

34
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,880
 and this matrix, and then we'll show the solution video,

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:55,880
 which is detailing this dual LP.
