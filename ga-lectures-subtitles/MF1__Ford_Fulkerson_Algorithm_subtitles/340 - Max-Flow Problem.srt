00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
 Here's the general formulation of the max-flow problem.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,390
 So the input is a flow network.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,960
 Flow network, once again,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,150
 consists of a directed graph with a specified start vertex and end vertex,

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,525
 and for each edge,

6
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:19,045
 we're given a capacity which is a positive number specified by c_sub_e.

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:23,350
 Our goal is to find the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from s to t.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,400
 This flow is specified by these variables f_ sub_e for each edge in the directed graph.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,005
 Now what are the constraints on these flows?

10
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,485
 The first constraint is the capacity constraint.

11
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:40,050
 For every edge, the flow along that edge cannot exceed the capacity of that edge,

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,900
 and the flow must be non-negative.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,645
 The second constraint is conservation of flow.

14
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,465
 The flow originates at the source vertex s and ends

15
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:53,091
 at the sync vertex t. But for all other vertices,

16
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:57,585
 so for all v in the vertex set minus s and t,

17
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:59,475
 for all such vertices v,

18
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,470
 the flow must be conserved.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,910
 So the flow into v must equal the flow out of v.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,505
 Nothing can be lost or gained at vertex v. Formerly,

21
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:11,305
 the flow into v is the following.

22
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:17,475
 It's a sum over edges w to v of the flow along this edge which is specified by f_sub_wv,

23
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:25,950
 and the flow out of v is a sum over edges v to z of the flow along that edge,

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
 which is specified by f_sub_vz.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,320
 A valid flow is one which satisfies

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,020
 the capacity constraints and conserves

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,020
 the flow at every vertex except for the source and the sync.
