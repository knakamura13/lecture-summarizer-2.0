00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,125
 Here's our summary from the previous slide.

2
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,160
 If program J on input J terminates,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,725
 then our new evil program harmful never terminates.

4
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:10,260
 It gets into this go to loop,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,040
 and then it has an infinite loop.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,770
 On the other hand, if program J on input J never terminates,

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,580
 so it has an infinite loop.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,805
 Then our new evil program goes into the else statement.

9
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:22,410
 And it exits right away,

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,270
 and therefore it terminates.

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,390
 Now, we need to derive a paradox or a contradiction.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,665
 What we do is we set the input J to be this program harmful which we just defined.

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,614
 So harmful is this short one line program,

14
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:39,180
 and we use that as the input to harmful itself.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,040
 Now the question is, does the program harmful when it takes itself as input,

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
 does it terminate or not?

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,237
 Well there are two possibilities,

18
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:50,100
 either it does terminate or it has an infinite loop.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,105
 Let's consider both possibilities.

20
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:57,135
 Suppose program harmful when it takes itself as input does terminate.

21
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,965
 Going up to the above summary,

22
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:01,260
 if J on J terminates,

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,075
 then harmful on J never terminates because it gets into this go to statement.

24
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:08,550
 So plugging in J equals harmful,

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,360
 we have that harmful on harmful never terminates.

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,295
 So if the program harmful on itself as input terminates,

27
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:21,560
 then harmful on itself is input never terminates.

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,480
 That's a contradiction. Therefore this can't be the case.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,910
 So it must be the case that when we run program harmful on itself as input,

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,500
 then it never terminates.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,770
 What happens in this scenario? Well, let's look above.

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,355
 In this scenario when J on J never terminates,

33
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:42,720
 then harmful on J terminates because it goes into this else statement,

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,540
 and it exits the program harmful immediately.

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,450
 Once again, if the program harmful when it takes itself as input never terminates,

36
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,440
 then what we conclude is that harmful on itself terminates.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,680
 Again, we have a contradiction,

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,105
 so this can't be the case.

39
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:02,160
 So it can't be the case that it terminates,

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,410
 and can't be the case that it never terminates.

41
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,090
 Since either case leads to a contradiction,

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,500
 our initial assumption that the program terminator which solves

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,355
 the halting problem on every input exists must be impossible.

44
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:16,110
 And therefore there does not exist

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,005
 a program which solves the halting problem on every input.

46
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:19,005
 And that completes the proof of the theorem.
