Now in general, we have n variables. So we're going to line n dimensional space. Now n is large, so we're in high dimensional space. Now we m constraints plus the n non-negativity constraints. So we have a total n plus m constraints. Now what's our feasible region? Now, each constraint corresponds to a half space and n dimensions. Now the feasible region are those points which satisfy all n plus m constraints. So we want to lie in all n plus m half spaces. So the feasible region corresponds to the intersection of these n plus m half spaces. Now this is going to correspond to a convex polyhedron in n dimensional space. Now the vertices of this polyhedron are the corners of it. Now how do you get a vertex of this polyhedron?
