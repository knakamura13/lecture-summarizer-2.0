Complex roots of unity distributed evenly around the unit circle, explored for n=2, n=4, n=8, n=16 where n=power of 2. For n=2, roots are at 1, -1; n=4 adds i, -i. Each increment in n subdivides circle further: n=8 step is pi/4, n=16 step is pi/8. Points at nth roots can be represented as omega_n to various powers. Omega_16 squared equals omega_8, linking roots of different n. When n=power of 2, n-th root squared gives n/2-th roots. Also, negative roots are defined, omega_n^j is opposite omega_n^(j+n/2), reflecting across the circle. This patterning continues around the unit circle equidistantly, demonstrating symmetrical properties of roots of unity.
