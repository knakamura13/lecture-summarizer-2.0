00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,985
 Let's take for granted that there's an order n times t,

2
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:05,610
 time algorithm for the subset-sum problem.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,900
 Now given that fact,

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:06,900
 the subset-sum problem is known to be in the class P. Is that true or false?
