1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,605
 Now what is this Stationery Distribution PI?

2
00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:04,842
 Is there a nice formula for this PI?

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:08,100
 In general no but in some cases yes, there is.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,555
 A simple case is when P is symmetric, what does this mean?

5
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:15,955
 That means the entry p_i_j is equal to the entry p_j_i.

6
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,035
 So if I look at row I and column J,

7
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:21,600
 the probability of going from I to J,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,785
 is the same as the probability of going from J to I,

9
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:28,405
 if that's the case then PI is the uniform distribution.

10
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,980
 PI of I is one over N for all I.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,625
 Now that's the simplest case,

12
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,855
 a generalization is known as reversibility.

13
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:37,125
 It's kind of a weighted version of symmetry,

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:42,300
 in which case PI is not necessarily uniform but we can still figure out the PI easily.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,505
 But what reversibility requires is that,

16
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:49,095
 if there's an edge from I to J then there has to be edge from J to I.

17
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:52,780
 Now symmetry says that these probabilities are the same.

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,435
 We don't necessarily need them to be the same

19
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,610
 but we need that if there's an edge from I to J,

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,685
 then there's an edge from J to I and vice versa.

21
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,195
 Now this is the case, then we might be able to figure out what PI is,

22
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,695
 we might have a nice formula for what PI is.

23
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:06,900
 If this is not the case,

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,960
 so the chain is not reversible.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,270
 So for instance there might be an edge from I to J but there is no edge from J to I.

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,524
 Then, in general we have no idea what the stationary distribution,

27
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:19,440
 there is no way to figure it out with a close formula.

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,130
 Now we can try to look at P to some high power and figure out what

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,260
 the stationary distribution is but we're not

30
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,540
 going to get some nice formulas such as this,

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,235
 for the stationary distribution.

32
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:33,130
 That completes our description of the introduction to Markov chains.

33
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,130
 Now we can dive into the details of the page rank algorithm.
