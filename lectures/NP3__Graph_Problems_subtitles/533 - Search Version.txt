My input is undirected graph as before and also a goal g. My output is an independent set S with size at least g. I want to output such a set S, if one exists, and if there is no independent set of such a size, then I simply output NO. It will be straightforward to show that this version of the problem is a search problem and therefore lies in the class NP. And, in fact, will prove now that the independent set problem is NP-complete.
