1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,565
 We just saw that the independent set problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:06,460
 I want to go back and look at this optimization version,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,105
 the Max Independent Set Problem,

4
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:10,885
 and I want to see what this implies about this problem.

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,975
 Now we have this class of problems NP,

6
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:18,350
 the independent set problem which we just proved is NP-complete lies in this class,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,285
 and there is a reduction from every problem in this class to the independent set problem.

8
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:27,065
 It's at least as hard as every problem in this class of NP.

9
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:31,190
 Now the max independent set problem is not known to lie in the class NP,

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,400
 so still outside this class.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,515
 Notice it's quite straightforward to reduce the independent set problem,

12
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,375
 to the max independent set problem.

13
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,810
 Here, I'm looking for an independent set of size at least g. Here,

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,250
 I'm looking for the maximum independent set.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,665
 If I find the maximum independent set and I check whether that size is at least g,

16
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,465
 that either gives me a solution,

17
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:52,520
 or it tells me there's no solution.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,040
 So it's quite straightforward to reduce the search version,

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,900
 to the optimization version.

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,970
 That means I have a reduction from the independent set problem,

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,710
 to the max independent set problem,

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,720
 and in fact I have a reduction from every problem in NP,

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,555
 to the max independent set problem,

24
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:10,060
 either going indirectly through the independent set problem or directly.

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,540
 What does that mean? That means

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,815
 the max independent set problem is at least as hard as everything in the class NP.

27
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:18,600
 Now if we knew it was in the class NP,

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,525
 then we would know it's NP-complete.

29
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,880
 But we don't know that. But how do we denote that it's

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,525
 at least as hard as everything in the class NP?

31
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:29,340
 We say that the max independent set problem is NP-hard.

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,885
 Notice it's NP-hard, not NP-complete.

33
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:36,560
 So NP-hard, means that it's at least as hard as everything in the class NP.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,870
 So there is a reduction from everything in

35
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,340
 the class NP to this problem max independent set.

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,270
 So if we can solve max independent set in polynomial time,

37
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,735
 then we can solve everything in NP in polynomial time.

38
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:52,185
 To be NP-complete, such as the independent set problem,

39
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,885
 then it has to be NP-hard,

40
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,320
 and it also has to lie in the set.

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,660
 So complete problems are the hardest in the set.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:01:59,660
 Hard problems are at least as hard as everything in
