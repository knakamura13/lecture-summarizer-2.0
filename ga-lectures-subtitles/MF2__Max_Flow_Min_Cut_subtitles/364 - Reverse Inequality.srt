1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
 Now, we'll show the following inequality.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,625
 We'll show that max over the flows, F,

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:08,430
 the size of F. So the max flow size is at least,

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,120
 the capacity of the min ST-cut.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,715
 We just proved that the max-flow size is at most,

6
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,145
 the min ST-cut capacity.

7
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:17,880
 Now if we prove this inequality,

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,635
 then we shown that it's the quality,

9
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:22,050
 that the left hand side equals the right hand side.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,360
 To prove this inequality, what we're going to do,

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,111
 is we're going to take the flow F*,

12
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:28,560
 produced by the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,325
 What do we know about this flow?

14
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:32,415
 The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm stops,

15
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:35,570
 when there's no augmenting path in the residual network.

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,665
 So we know that this flow, F*,

17
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:43,105
 has no path from S to T in this residual network for this flow.

18
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:46,505
 What we're going to prove, is that for any flow, F*,

19
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,665
 which has no augmenting path in the residual network,

20
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,675
 we're going to construct an ST-cut,

21
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,225
 L, R which has the following property.

22
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:56,670
 The size of this flow, F*,

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,410
 equals the capacity of this cut that we construct.

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,590
 Now once we prove this,

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,990
 we claim that it's done.

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,510
 Why does this statement imply this inequality?

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,865
 Well this is one particular flow, F*.

28
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:12,305
 How does this compare to the max-flow size?

29
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,910
 Certainly, if we maximize over the flows F,

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,635
 the size of this flow,

31
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:19,005
 is at least the size F*.

32
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:22,640
 It maybe quality if F* is a max-flow,

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,410
 but certainly, the max flow is at least the size of F*.

34
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,088
 And how does the capacity of this particular cut L, R,

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,895
 compare to the capacity of the min ST-cut?

36
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:35,770
 Well certainly, the capacity of this particular cut,

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,750
 is at least the minimum capacity of any kind.

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,115
 So if we prove this middle equality,

39
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:45,330
 that the size of F* equals the capacity of this cut L,

40
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,875
 R that we construct,

41
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,340
 then that implies that the max flow size is at least,

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,500
 the min ST-cut capacity,

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,175
 which is what we want to prove.

44
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:54,175
 So it just remains to prove this equality
