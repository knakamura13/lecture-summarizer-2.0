00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,630
 To make sure you understand what's involved in proving that a problem is in the class NP,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,260
 let's take a short quiz.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,605
 The max independent set problem is in the class NP.

4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:12,235
 Is that statement true or false?

5
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:14,960
 To be more precise, let's change this statement slightly.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,150
 So let's say the max independent set problem is known to be in the class NP.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,960
 Is that statement true or false?

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,185
 I added this qualification, known to be,

9
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:30,760
 because there are scenarios such as P equals NP that would change things.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:30,760
 So this will be the standard form for our true false questions of this type.
