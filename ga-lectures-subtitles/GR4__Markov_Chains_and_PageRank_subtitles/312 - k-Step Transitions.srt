1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,762
 Now if we look at this entry (i,j) , in this matrix P,

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,259
 this transition matrix P,

3
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,755
 corresponding to the way to the adjacency matrix.

4
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:12,570
 This tells me the probability of making the transition from I to J in one step.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,670
 So if I'm in state I at time T,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,680
 then PIJ is the probability that I'm in State J at time T plus one.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,990
 Now what we just saw is that if we look at the square of

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,622
 the transition matrix, so P squared,

9
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:27,210
 then the entry (i,j) tells me the probability of going

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,340
 from state I to state J in two steps.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,600
 And in general for any non-negative integer K,

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,070
 P to the K. So the Kth power of this transition matrix

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,070
 P. This tells me the probability of making a transition in exactly K steps.
