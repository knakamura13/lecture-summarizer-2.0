Examining the progression of matrix P raised to a higher power T, eventually as T approaches infinity, each row of P converges to a specific row vector pi. This convergence suggests that the probability of being in any given state J at time T is represented by pi(J), irrespective of the initial state. For instance, in a given 6210 scenario, regardless of the starting point, the probability of two distinct states at time T is 0.104 for sleeping and 0.406 for playing Starcraft. This concept is identified as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain, a state to which the system eventually stabilizes and remains constant over time. The fundamental question addressed is whether all Markov chains have a stationary distribution and whether it is unique or if there can be multiple stationary distributions. The existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution is crucial for applications such as the page rank algorithm, where the stationary distribution of a Markov chain represents the likelihood of visiting a webpage in an infinite random walk across web pages. Lastly, the discussion hints at an intention to explore stationary distributions from a linear algebra perspective, suggesting a mathematical analysis to come.
