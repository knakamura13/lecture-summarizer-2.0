Designing a dynamic programming algorithm involves two primary steps. Initially, we define the sub-problem, typically considering a problem on a prefix of the input. We use K(I) to represent the maximum value obtainable with the first I objects. By adjusting the available set from N to I objects, we tailor the scope of the problem. The subsequent step is to establish a recursive relationship, formulating K(I) in terms of preceding, smaller sub-problems, such as K(1) through K(I-1).
