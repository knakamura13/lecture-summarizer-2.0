1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
 Look at the sum of all the foreground and background likelihoods.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,310
 So, let capital L denote the sum over

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,480
 all pixels of their foreground likelihood plus their background likelihood.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,180
 We color our weight for

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,450
 a particular partition FB at weight fi for each pixel assigned to the foreground,

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,510
 and bj for each pixel assigned to the background.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,975
 Notice, that this quantity is equal to capital L

8
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:30,015
 minus the sum of the pixels assigned to the foreground of their background,

9
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:33,960
 minus the sum of all the pixels assigned to the background of their foreground.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,720
 Because, if we take the sum over the pixels assigned

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,643
 to the foreground of their foreground likelihood,

12
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:45,175
 plus sum of the pixels assigned to the background of their foreground likelihood,

13
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:50,100
 we get the total likelihood of all pixels for the foreground.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,645
 This is the first term in this sum.

15
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:56,280
 Simply by summing this term with this term,

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,680
 we get this total likelihood of all pixels for the background.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,940
 Now, if we subtract a separation penalty for separated edges,

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,760
 now think of this ij as an un-ordered pair.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,530
 So, I don't have to write both cases,

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,860
 i and F, or j and B,

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,115
 this un-ordered pair that covers the other case, where i is in B,

22
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,565
 and j is an F. Now,

23
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:22,830
 to maintain equality, I want to subtract this term also from the other side.

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,170
 Now, what do you notice about this left hand side?

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,620
 Well, this is exactly our definition of the weight, W of FB.

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,030
 Now, we're going to define a new weight W-prime of FB,

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,310
 which is the sum of these three terms,

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,038
 and then the right hand side will be equal to L,

29
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:38,038
 capital L minus W-prime of FB.
