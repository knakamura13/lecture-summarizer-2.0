Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms both address the max-flow problem. Ford-Fulkerson uses augmenting paths in the residual graph via DFS or BFS, with a runtime of O(M*C), assuming integral capacities. Edmonds-Karp is a variant of Ford-Fulkerson, employing BFS for finding paths. Its runtime outperforms Ford-Fulkerson at O(m^2*n) and does not insist on integral capacities, only positivity. This session will recap Ford-Fulkerson and highlight Edmonds-Karp's distinctions before exploring the latter's runtime analysis in depth.
