Proved a fundamental property for SCC (Strongly Connected Component) algorithm correctness. The property states that the vertex with the highest post-order number is in a source SCC. Demonstrated that if a vertex in one SCC (S) can reach another (S'), the max post-order number in S is greater than that in S'. This leads to a method for topologically sorting SCCs by their max post-order numbers in decreasing order, ensuring edges progress from higher to lower post-order numbers. Hence, the SCC with the largest max post-order number, and thus the vertex with the highest post-order number, is positioned at the start, qualifying as a source SCC. Proving this enables topological sorting of SCCs based on max post-order numbers and confirms the initial assumption used in the SCC algorithm. The goal is to substantiate the simpler claim to validate the algorithm's design.
