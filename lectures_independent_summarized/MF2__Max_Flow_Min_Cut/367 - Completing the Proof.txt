Proved the max flow min cut theorem: max flow size equals min s-t cut capacity. Constructed an s-t cut from a flow without an augmenting path in the residual networkâ€”t isn't reachable from s, creating a valid s-t cut. Showed flow size f* equals the cut capacity, indicating both are optimal (max flow, min s-t cut). Ford-Fulkerson and similar algorithms are correct if they stop with no augmenting path. Demonstrated a method to verify max flow and construct a min s-t cut using max flow f* and vertices reachable from s in the residual network. This method applies both to prove algorithm correctness (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp) and in image segmentation applications.
