Proved P, chosen as pivot in algorithm, effective by median-of-medians approach. Partitioned array A into n/5 groups of 5, finding each group's median. Recursively found median of these medians, determining P. Relabeled groups by median size for proof clarity, identified G1 with smallest and Gn/5 with largest median. Focused on middle group Gn/10, median becomes pivot P. Identified proved elements ≤ P: n/10 medians from subset S plus 2 guaranteed smaller elements per group, yielding ≥ 3n/10 elements ≤ P. By excluding these from A, subset > P is ≤ 7n/10, smaller than 3/4n definition of a good pivot. Similarly, ≥ 3n/10 elements ≥ P, leaving ≤ 7n/10 elements < P, confirming P as a good pivot by ensuring both partitions around it contain at most 7n/10 elements, meeting good pivot criteria. Proof of claim complete.
