00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
 Recall, our goal is to compute A x B x C x D. Now,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,785
 matrix multiplication is associative.

3
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:08,387
 So, there are many ways to compute them.

4
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:11,380
 The standard ways to compute A x B.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,650
 Take that product, x C,

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,475
 take that product, x D. But there are other things we can do.

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,580
 For instance, we can do A x B first,

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,630
 then we can do C x D second,

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,050
 and then we can multiply these two together.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,690
 Or we can start with B x C,

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,060
 multiply that with A, and finally,

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,895
 multiply that with D. Or you start with C x D,

13
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:38,890
 multiply that with B, finally multiply that with A.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,640
 Which of these is best?

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,200
 That's what we want to determine.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,825
 Which is the best or what is the cost of the optimal parenthesization.

17
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,400
 In order to figure out which is

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,540
 the best or most efficient method for computing the product of these matrices,

19
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,185
 we need to assign a cost for each of these operations.

20
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,720
 So, let's take a look again at matrix multiplication and then we

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,720
 can figure out a reasonable notion of cost.
