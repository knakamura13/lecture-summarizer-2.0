Using a simple algorithm based on Fermat's Little Theorem to test the primality of an n-bit number r, where a randomly selected Z from the range 1 to r-1 is used for Fermat's Test. If Z^r-1 % r equals 1, r might be prime; if not, r is definitively composite as Z acts as a witness. This method does not address Carmichael numbers but is still efficient for primality testing, with the theorem stating at least half the numbers in the set will witness r's compositeness if r is indeed composite.
