Residual networks are tied to the flow network in max-flow problems, altering based on the current flow, denoted as fe. The residual network, expressed as G^f, maintains the flow networkâ€™s vertices but has modified edges dependent on fe, with differing weights/capacities. These edges include forward edges, mirroring the flow network but with capacities reduced by fe, and backward edges, existing only if there's positive flow in the original network, their capacities equating to fe, effectively allowing flow negation. Residual networks also necessitate removing antiparallel edges from the original flow network to accommodate both forward and backward edges without issue.
