Max-flow size equals the flow from the source (s) to the sink (t), and must be less than or equal to the capacity of the min st-cut in a network. In an example network, cut L-R has a capacity of 27, representing the edge capacity from L to R, the only exit path for the flow from s to t. Flow can't surpass edge capacities, so max-flow's size is limited to 27. Proving that the flow size equals the net flow out of set L (total out minus total in) will confirm that max-flow is at most the cut's capacity. This proof is straightforward and also contributes to showing the max-flow's size matches at least the min st-cut capacity, a fact to be demonstrated later.
