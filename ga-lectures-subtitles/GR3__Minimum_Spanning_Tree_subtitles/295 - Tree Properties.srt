00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,075
 Before we dive into the algorithm and the proof of correctness,

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:08,185
 let's review some basic graph theory about properties of a tree.

3
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:11,675
 Now, I would remind you, a tree is a connected acyclic graph.

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:17,145
 Here's an example of a graph on 17 vertices with a tree denoted by the blue edges.

5
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:22,255
 The first basic property is that a tree on n vertices has exactly n - 1 edges.

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,700
 In this example, it has 17 vertices and there are 16 edges.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,020
 To see why this property holds,

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,180
 you'll notice that you need a least n - 1 edges to connect up the n vertices.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,730
 And if you have more than n - 1 edges,

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,605
 then you'll have at least one cycle.

11
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:39,510
 The next property about a tree is that, in a tree,

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,620
 there is exactly one path between every pair of vertices.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,405
 Clearly, if there are zero paths between a pair of vertices,

14
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:48,890
 then that graph, that tree is not connected.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,865
 And also, if there are two or more paths between a pair of vertices,

16
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:55,130
 then we have a cycle in this graph.

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,700
 So, it's not acyclic.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,715
 So, in order to be connected and acyclic,

19
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:02,115
 there has to be exactly one path between every pair of vertices.

20
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:03,920
 Now, the final property is the one that we're going to

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,415
 use in our proof of the cut property.

22
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:10,350
 We're going to construct a sub-graph and we want to establish that it's a tree.

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,870
 How are we going to prove there's a tree?

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,390
 Well, we're going to show that it's connected and

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,830
 that the number of edges is exactly n - 1.

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,430
 Any connected graph with exactly n - 1 edges is a tree.

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,415
 Now, this third property follows from combining the first property

28
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:28,925
 and the second property together and apply the third property.

29
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:31,430
 This last property is the one that we're going to utilize later.

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,115
 So, let me repeat it again.

31
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:36,370
 In order to establish that a graph is a tree,

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,510
 I just have to show you that the number of edges is

33
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,510
 exactly n - 1 and that this graph is connected.
