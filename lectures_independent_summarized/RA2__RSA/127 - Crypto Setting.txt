Alice needs to securely send a message (M) to Bob in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. To accomplish this, Alice encrypts M using an encryption scheme to produce E(M), which is sent to Bob through a communication line visible to Eve. Bob decrypts E(M) using his private decryption key, which Eve cannot access. The system used is a public key cryptosystem, RSA. In RSA, Bob generates a public key (N and E) by multiplying two prime numbers (P and Q) and selecting E that is coprime to (P-1)(Q-1). He broadcasts N and E publicly. Anyone, including Alice, can send messages to Bob by encrypting them with his public key. Bob is the only one who knows P and Q, allowing him to compute his private key (D), the modular multiplicative inverse of E modulo (P-1)(Q-1). D enables Bob to decrypt messages by raising them to the power of D and taking the result modulo N. This process does not require prior private communication between Alice and Bob, as public key encryption allows for secure message transmission without prior key exchange.
