1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,735
 So let's go ahead and try to find the recurrence for our new sub-problem definition.

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,105
 The length that the longest common sub-sequence,

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,462
 in the first I characters of X and the first J characters of Y.

4
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:12,370
 And let's go back and look at our earlier example.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,150
 Here's our earlier example, and notice that here,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,980
 they're both of the same length and just to illustrate our new sub-problem definition,

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,220
 let's add in one more character to Y,

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,190
 so there are now of different length.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,840
 And if you recall our approach from before, what we're going to do is,

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,110
 we're going to look at the last character of both sequences,

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,560
 and we're going to condition on whether they're the same or different.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,080
 If they're the same and then we can possibly match them together,

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,180
 if they're different, there's no way we can match them together.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,895
 So let's do the case with a different first.

15
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:47,205
 Our key insight, is that in this case with the last characters are unequal,

16
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:52,515
 then the longest common sub-sequence either ends in A the last character of X,

17
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:56,340
 or in the last character of Y which in this case is D,

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,580
 or it ends in neither.

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,018
 Now if it ends in A,

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,685
 that means it does not end in,

21
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:03,390
 it does not end in D,

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,895
 it does not include D in the final solution, okay?

23
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:08,230
 There might be other occurrences of D,

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,490
 but we're differentiating the multiple occurrences of this character.

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,175
 This character is not included in the final solution,

26
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,970
 or this character is not included in the final solution,

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,330
 or both of these final characters are not included in the optimal solution.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,265
 So there are three cases to consider,

29
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:33,315
 either the last character of X is not used in the optimal solution,

30
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,960
 the last character Y is not used in the optimal solution,

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,035
 or the last character of both is not used in the optimal solution.

32
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:41,010
 If the last character of both is not used,

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,280
 we can get there by dropping the last character of X and then dropping

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,800
 the last character or Y or vice versa or dropping less character Y and then X.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,120
 So there's really only two cases to consider,

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,295
 either we drop the last character of X,

37
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:54,910
 or the last character of Y,

38
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,910
 and we're going to take the best of those two.

39
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,135
 So let's recap, so if we dropped the last character of

40
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:04,220
 X and X I is not used in the optimal solution then,

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,935
 L of I J is the same as L of I minus one,

42
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:12,100
 which has just dropped X I from it and J.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,305
 The other scenario, is that we dropped the last character of Y and in this case L of I J,

44
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,020
 is L of I,

45
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,405
 J minus one, we just dropped Y J from Y.

46
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:26,005
 How do we know which of these two is the better solution?

47
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,975
 We just take the larger of the two.

48
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:29,160
 So that's going to be our recurrence.

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,370
 Our recurrences is L of I J is going to be the max of these two possible solutions.

50
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,935
 Let's recap, in this case where X I and Y J are different,

51
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:43,730
 so the last characters of the two prefixes are different,

52
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,885
 then we have a recurrence.

53
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:49,290
 L of I J is going to be the best of the two possible scenarios.

54
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,460
 Either we dropped the last character of X,

55
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,980
 and therefore we have this solution for I minus one characters of X,

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,495
 and J characters from Y,

57
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:03,210
 or we drop the last character from Y and we get the solution,

58
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,770
 L of I J minus one,

59
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,100
 and which of the two where we're going to take?

60
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,250
 We're gonna take the better of the two.

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,895
 Which means we're going to take the one which has larger length which is the max.

62
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:15,830
 So this defines a recurrence for the case when X I is not equal to Y J.

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,830
 Now let's do the case where X I equals Y..
