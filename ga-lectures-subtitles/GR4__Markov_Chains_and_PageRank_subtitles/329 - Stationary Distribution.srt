1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
 So recall what is a stationary distribution?

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,260
 A stationary distribution is any vector,

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,890
 any distribution pi which satisfies the following identity,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,985
 pi times p, the transition matrix, equals pi.

5
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:19,440
 So pi is an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 1 or in other words,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,625
 if I'm in distribution pi and I do one step of the random walk to find by P,

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,230
 then I'm still in distribution pi.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,660
 So pi is an invariant distribution.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,935
 Once I reach it I stay in it.

10
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:36,325
 Let's expand this out to see what this means a little bit more precisely.

11
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,130
 I have pi here.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,985
 If there are a million web pages then pi is a row vector of size a million.

13
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:44,290
 Now I have P here.

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,560
 Now if there are a million web pages then P is of size a million by a million.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,205
 Now let me just flip this.

16
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,750
 So let us look at pi equals pi times

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,845
 p. So I just flip the left and right hand side and here's the right hand side,

18
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:03,835
 pi equals pi times P. Let's look at an entry X here.

19
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:07,560
 So pi of X, this X entry here.If there are

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,930
 a million web pages and let's say X is maybe the 900th entry.

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,795
 How do I get this entry?

22
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:17,670
 Well, this X is going to define the column I looked at over here.

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,870
 So this is the 900th entry here and it's going to be the 900th column here.

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,030
 And then what I do, I take this column and then multiply by this row.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,400
 So Y is going to vary over this row and

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,300
 then Y is going to vary over the rows of this matrix.

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,540
 I'm going to multiply the first entries together

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,280
 plus the second entries multiplied together and so on.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,705
 So I'm going to sum over Y,

30
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,720
 the number of Ys is the number of web pages.

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,503
 So Y is varying over all vertices in the graph,

32
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:49,980
 all web pages in the graph and I take the Ys entry over here which is pi of

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,895
 Y and I multiply by the Ys entry in this column which is the P, Y over X.

34
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:58,320
 So I do the dot product of this row vector with

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,610
 this column vector and that gives me the X entry in pi.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,275
 Now let's look at this term.

37
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,575
 What do we know about this term?

38
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:10,270
 What do we say that the transition matrix was for this random walk and the last line?

39
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,375
 Well if there's an edge from Y to X and it's one over the number of outgoing edges

40
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:20,605
 out of Y and there's no edge from Y to X then this transition matrix is zero.

41
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:24,600
 There's no probability of this random walk going from Y to X in one step.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,785
 So, for any Y which does not have an edge to X,

43
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:30,585
 then this term is zero.

44
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:35,290
 So we can drop it. So we only have to look at Ys which have an edge to X.

45
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,155
 In other words we only have to look at Ys which are in the in neighbor set of X.

46
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:46,655
 So we can simplify this sum over all Ys to only Ys which are in the in neighbors.

47
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:50,400
 So now we only consider those Ys which have an edge from Y to

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,600
 X and we get pi of Y again and now we can replace this term P,

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,145
 Y of X by this quantity.

50
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,825
 So we're going to divide pi of Y by the number of our neighbors of Y

51
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:06,220
 because we know that if there's an edge from Y to X then P,

52
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,865
 Y, X is exactly this.

53
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:11,485
 So we can replace P, Y, X by this.

54
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:15,350
 So we have that pi of X equals this quantity. So what have we shown?

55
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,385
 We've shown that the stationary distribution of this random walk on the web graph.

56
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:22,400
 If we do this simple random walk on the web graph,

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,490
 it's stationary distribution satisfies the following identity.

58
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,900
 This is what we just saw because pi equals pi times

59
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,195
 P and we expanded our pi times P and we got this slightly simpler expression.

60
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,140
 Now, where have we seen this before?

61
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,580
 Well, what we saw before when we ignored Markov chains and we

62
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,045
 defined the rank of a web page in terms of citation count intuition.

63
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:47,090
 We got this definition.

64
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,770
 And look, they're identical.

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,520
 This definition and this definition are identical.

66
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,890
 So these two views are identical.

67
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,450
 This intuition from citation counts and this intuition from random walks,

68
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,690
 we get equivalent definitions.

69
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,695
 Now this random walk interpretation is very appealing. Think about it.

70
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:06,410
 So you started any web page,

71
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,215
 you run the random walk.

72
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,215
 So you just do random surfing.

73
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:12,545
 Now what's the chance you edit a page X.

74
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:16,430
 Well, an important web page like CNN or Google,

75
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,320
 I mean, there's probably a pretty good chance we're going to end

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,765
 up at that web page when we do a random surfing.

77
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,420
 Whereas somebody is like my web page well there's

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,300
 probably a very small chance that we're going to end up there.

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,750
 So the stationary distribution of this random walk is

80
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,705
 a very natural nice appealing measure of the importance of a web page.

81
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:34,705
 So, this is what we wanted to find the page rank of the web page to be.
