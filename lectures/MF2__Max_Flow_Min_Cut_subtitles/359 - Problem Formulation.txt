Let's formally state the min st-cut problem. The input is a flow network. So we have a directed graph with a specified start and end vertex. And for every edge, we have a positive capacity. Now the output for the min st-cut problem, it's an st-cut (L, R), so s has to be an L and t has to be an R. And we want to find that st-cut with minimum capacity. Recall the capacity of this cut is the sum of the capacities of the edges that go from L to R, and we ignore the edges that go from R to L. Now let's take a look at this cut that we looked at earlier. So the set L contains s, a, b and f. Now, the capacity of this cut is A plus two, plus two, plus five, plus seven, plus three. So the capacity is 27. We want to find the cut of minimum capacity. Here is an st-cut of minimum capacity. R simply contains T and L contains everybody else. The capacity of this cut is 12. We just have these two edges exiting L to R. How do we know this is min st-cut? Well, we're going to prove the Max-flow-min-cut theorem which says that the size of the Max flow equals the size of the min st-cut. We know there's a flow in this graph of size 12 and since there is an st-cut of capacity 12, therefore we know that this flow and this st-cut are both optimal.
