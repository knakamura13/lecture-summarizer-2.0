1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
 Now for the background, we do similar,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,780
 using this vertex t. So,

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,490
 we have an edge from every vertex of

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,220
 the original undirected graph to t. So these edges are going to T,

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,655
 whereas edges came out of S. So S was a source and T is a sync,

6
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:19,370
 and the capacity of these edges two t will be the background likelihood.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,325
 So now we've got the foreground likelihood and the background likelihood encoded,

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:25,940
 and we have the separation penalties encoded.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,300
 So here's our final graph,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,335
 and we've specified the capacities along every edge.

11
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:32,460
 Therefore, we've defined a flow network,

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:32,460
 and we can use this as our input to the max-flow problem.
