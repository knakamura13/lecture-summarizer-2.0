A residual graph's edges are adjusted during flow network operations based on whether they are in the network or are back edges. A forward edge is added when its flow is lessened from full capacity, implying a back edge was used in an augmenting path; it's removed when its flow meets capacity due to augmentation on that edge. Conversely, a back edge is added when flow on the forward edge starts from zero, indicative of the forward edge's use in augmentation; it is removed when the forward edge's flow is depleted by sending flow back, meaning the back edge was on the augmenting path. Thus, edge adjustments in residual networks are directly linked to their roles in augmenting paths that alter flow levels.
