Search problems involve confirming a proposed solution in polynomial time relative to input size. Class P problems can be both solved and verified within polynomial time. The P vs. NP question explores whether problem-solving is inherently more difficult than solution verification. P equals NP suggests generating solutions (proofs) is as easy as verifying them. This paradigm shift would mean if one could verify, one could also solve problems within the same complexity bounds. However, the general consensus leans toward P not equaling NP, implying that verification—like checking a proof line by line—is simpler than problem-solving or proof creation, which seems intuitively more challenging. The discussion mostly centers around search problems not formally defined but understood in computational complexity.
