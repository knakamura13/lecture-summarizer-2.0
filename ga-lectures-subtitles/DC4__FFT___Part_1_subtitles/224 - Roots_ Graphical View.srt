1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
 Now we're trying to find those Z.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,285
 Where Z raised to the power n equals 1.

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:07,860
 And let's draw the number 1 on our complex plane.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,710
 What is its point in polar coordinates?

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,840
 Its distance 1 obviously, from the origin.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,110
 What's the angle? The angle is zero.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:22,315
 It's also 2pi or 4pi or 6pi or 2pi times j for any integer j.

8
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:25,080
 And note j can also be negative number.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,795
 So the angle is any multiple of 2pi.

10
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:31,565
 Now let's say Z equals the point r theta in polar.

11
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:35,435
 We're looking at those Z where Z raised to the power n equals 1.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,820
 So it's equals 1 comma 2pi j.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,050
 Recall the expression for multiplying two complex numbers in polar coordinates.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,150
 So look at Z raised to the power n. So Z is r comma theta.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,450
 So Z to the n is r raised to the power n. And then we add up the angles.

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,450
 So we get n times theta.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,940
 Now we're assuming this equals 1.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,480
 So what does r equal and what does theta equal?

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,645
 Well, r raised to the power n equals 1.

20
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,060
 So then we know that r equals 1. So what does that mean?

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,630
 That means that all the complex roots of unity lie on this unit circle,

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,460
 this circle of radius 1.

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,095
 Where do they line the circle?

24
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,535
 Well, we have to look at the angle.

25
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:18,955
 n times theta equals 2pi j. Solving for theta.

26
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:21,570
 We have 2pi j over n. Let's take

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,540
 the case n equals 8 and see what this looks like on the unit circle.

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,350
 The case j equals zero,

29
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,260
 corresponds to angle zero.

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,810
 So this is the point 1.

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,740
 That's good because we know that the point 1,

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,310
 that number 1 is an nth root of unity.

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,960
 Let's look at j equals 1.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,640
 So we got 2pi over n. What does this correspond to,

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,305
 this angle 2pi over n?

36
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:41,850
 It's like you took the whole pi,

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,080
 the whole circle, and you subdivided it into equal slices.

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,300
 For the case n equals 8,

39
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,520
 this angle is pi over 4.

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,085
 So this is the point 1 comma pi over 4. j equals 2 corresponds to this point which is i.

41
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:58,580
 Which is 1 comma pi over 2.

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,960
 Next point is 1 3 pi over 4.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,030
 And we get 1 pi which is negative 1.

44
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,040
 And we get 1 5 pi over 4, and so on.

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,065
 Notice that when we get to j equals 8, we repeat.

46
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:14,630
 We get back to this point 1. j equals 9,

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,835
 j equals 10, and so on.

48
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,110
 So notice there are n distinct values.

49
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,730
 And what we're doing is we're starting at the point

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:20,730
 1 and we're taking steps sizes of 2pi over n.
