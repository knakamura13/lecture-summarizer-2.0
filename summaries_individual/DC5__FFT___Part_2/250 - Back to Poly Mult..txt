Revisited polynomial multiplication algo, detailing final step with inverse FFT transforming poly C_of_x values to coeffs. Vector t used as first param, representing C_of_x values at 2n roots of unity. Second param is inverse of 2n-th root of unity, i.e., omega_2n^(2n-1). Running FFT with these params yields 2n points, denoted as vector C. Post-FFT, scale output by 1/2n to obtain C_of_x coeffs, finalizing the algo for both polynomial multiplication and convolution.
