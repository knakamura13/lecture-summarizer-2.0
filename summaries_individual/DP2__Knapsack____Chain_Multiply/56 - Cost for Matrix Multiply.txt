Matrix multiplication involves calculating the product Z from matrices W (a x b) and Y (b x c), resulting in Z's dimensions of a x c. To compute the entry Z(i,j), the inner product of row i from W and column j from Y is calculated. This requires b multiplications and b-1 additions for one entry. Since Z has a x c entries, the total cost involves a x c x b multiplications and a similar count of additions. However, multiplications are more computationally intensive; thus, the cost of computing Z, the product matrix of W times Y, is dominated by the multiplications, leading to a cost of a x b x c operations.
