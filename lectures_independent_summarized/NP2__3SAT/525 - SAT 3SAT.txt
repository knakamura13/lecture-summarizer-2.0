Formalized reduction from SAT to 3SAT involves handling clauses of an input formula: small clauses with â‰¤3 literals are kept unchanged; larger clauses are split into (k-2) new clauses using (k-3) new variables, as per a defined construction. Proving an input formula f is satisfiable iff its transformed version f' in 3SAT is satisfiable is straightforward. This is due to the fact that each clause C and its transformed version C' maintain the same satisfiability condition. To show a satisfying assignment for f' can be converted into one for f, auxiliary variables are disregarded, and the original variables' assignment ensures f's satisfiability.
