00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
 One of the key ideas for multiplying polynomials is that multiplying

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,050
 polynomials is easy when we have the polynomials in the values representation.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,315
 So suppose that we know the polynomial A(x) evaluated at two n points,

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:18,055
 x1 through x2n, and we know this polynomial B(x) at the same two n points.

5
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:21,360
 Then we can compute the product polynomial C(x) at

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,435
 these two n points by just computing the product of two numbers for each i.

7
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:31,720
 So C(xi) is the product of the number A(xi) and B(xi).

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,330
 This is just a number, and this is just a number.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,954
 Since C(xi) is just the product of two numbers,

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,275
 it takes order one time for each i,

11
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:43,890
 and therefore it takes order n total time to compute this product polynomial.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,159
 Now why do we take A and B at two n points?

13
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,340
 Well, C is a polynomial of degree at most 2n minus two.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,800
 So we needed at least 2n minus one points.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,940
 So two n points suffices.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,850
 The summary is that, if we have the value of these polynomials,

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,160
 A(x) and B(x), at n,

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,495
 or two n points,

19
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:08,910
 then we compute this product polynomial at the same points in order n total time.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,100
 So what we're going to do is we're going to use FFT to

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,968
 convert from the coefficients to the values,

22
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:17,130
 this is going to take order n log n time to do this conversion,

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,800
 and then I'll take order n total time to

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,980
 compute the product polynomial at these two n points,

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,830
 and then we do FFT to convert back from the value of C of x,

26
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,130
 at these two n points,

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,568
 back to the coefficients for C(x),

28
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:34,795
 and that again will take order n log n time.

29
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,425
 So let's dive in now to see how we do FFT,

30
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:37,425
 which converts from the coefficients to the values.
