1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,885
 Let's look at the case when multiplicative inverses do not exist.

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,645
 Why don't they exist?

3
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:09,600
 So in the case where X and N have a common divisor.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,470
 So their GCD is strictly greater than one,

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,215
 in which case this theorem says that the inverse of X mod N does not exist.

6
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,695
 Let's take a look at why that happens.

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:22,110
 Let me give you the intuition for the proof.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,195
 Let me do the simple case where X and N both even.

9
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:28,125
 So then they have a common divisor of two.

10
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,795
 If you understand this case then you can understand the general case.

11
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:34,071
 Suppose X did have an inverse mod N,

12
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,935
 let's call it Z.

13
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,460
 So what does that mean?

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,750
 That means that X times Z is congruent to

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,870
 one mod N. So how can XZ be congruent to one mod N?

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:51,535
 That means XZ is either N+1 or it might be 2N+1 or 3N+1.

17
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:55,365
 In general, it's some multiple of N+1.

18
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:58,140
 So it's QN+1 for an integer Q.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,270
 Now X we assumed was even.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,090
 So what is X times Z?

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,800
 Even number times some other number is going to be an even number.

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,435
 Okay? Because it still has two as a divisor.

23
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:13,935
 Okay. So XZ is even because X is even.

24
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,655
 Now N is even. So what about Q times N?

25
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,800
 That's going to be even as well just the same as before.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
 So XZ is even and QN is even.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,200
 What about QN+1?

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,775
 We take an even plus one we got an odd number.

29
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:29,090
 So this is an odd number. This is an even number.

30
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,470
 How can they be equal? They can't be equal.

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,570
 So that's our contradiction.

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,825
 Therefore, there is no inverse of X mod N. And similarly,

33
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:40,815
 if X and N just share a common divisor then

34
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:46,050
 you have a similar proof to explain why the inverse does not exist.

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,435
 Now the interesting case is when they are relatively prime to each other,

36
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,025
 so their greatest common divisor is one.

37
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,810
 So they have no common divisors except for one.

38
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,595
 Then the inverse exists. Why is that the case?

39
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,110
 Can we prove why the inverse exists?

40
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,835
 We'll prove it exists by actually giving an algorithm for finding it.

41
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:08,240
 We'll actually find it and by finding it we prove its existence.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,630
 Okay? What is the algorithm we're going to use for finding it?

43
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,620
 Well some of you might have seen Euclid's algorithm

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,250
 before for computing the greatest common divisor.

45
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,220
 So even if we want to check whether the inverse exists or not we have to

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,955
 compute the GCD of X and N. Check whether they're relatively prime to each other.

47
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:29,115
 I mean these are big numbers so it's not easy to just eyeball and check.

48
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,840
 So we got to run an algorithm to check

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,870
 the greatest common divisor and see whether it's one or not.

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,420
 That algorithm for that is Euclid's algorithm

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,915
 which is very simple recursive algorithm and we're going to see it in a moment.

52
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:45,105
 And then a slight modification of Euclid's algorithm is extended Euclidean algorithm

53
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:47,575
 and that extended Euclidean algorithm will give us

54
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,060
 the greatest common divisor of X and N and if

55
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,275
 the greatest common divisor is one it will give us the inverse of X mod N. And therefore,

56
00:02:56,275 --> 00:03:00,390
 that will prove the existence of the inverse of X mod N. Okay?

57
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,940
 So let's go ahead and dive into Euclid's algorithm and

58
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:02,940
 the extended version of the algorithm to find the inverse.
