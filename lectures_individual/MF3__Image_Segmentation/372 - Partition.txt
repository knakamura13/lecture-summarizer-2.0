Our goal is to partition the vertices of pixels into two sets F and B. F will correspond to the foreground pixels and capital B will be the pixels that we assign to the background. Now, for a particular partition B, we need some score or weight to measure the likelihood of this partition. Thus, we defined the weight of this partition as the following for each pixel assigned to the foreground we get FB for each pixel assigned to the background we get BJ have used different indices for these two sets to avoid some confusion. Finally, we pay a separation penalty for separated edges. This is a penalty so we're going to subtract it. And, we're going to look at all edges where the first endpoint is an F and the other end point is in B or vice versa. And, the penalty is of course CIJ. This defines the weight for a particular partition FB. So, for a particular assignment of the pixels to foreground and background we have a weight associated with it. Our goal is to find the partition or assignment of pixels to foreground and background with maximum weight.
