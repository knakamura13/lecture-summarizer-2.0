For any flow f and s-t cut L, R in a graph, the flow size is established to equal the total outflow from set L minus the inflow into L. The outflow from L is the sum of flows on edges from L to outside L, while the inflow to L is the sum of flows on edges from outside L to L. To maintain equality while examining the flows on edges within L, both inflow and outflow are added and subtracted. When combined, the positive terms (1st and 3rd) account for the total outflow from vertices in L, while the negative terms (2nd and 4th) give total inflow to vertices in L. With the source s in L having zero inflow, the terms for s adjust the total to just the outflow from s. For vertices in L excluding s, the inflow equals the outflow due to flow conservation, nullifying their contributions to the total and leaving only the outflow from s. This conclusively shows that the flow size f equals net outflow from set L, meeting the proof's objective.
