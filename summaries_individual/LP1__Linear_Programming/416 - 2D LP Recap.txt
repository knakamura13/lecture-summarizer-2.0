Maximize X_1 + 6X_2, subject to constraints: X_1 ≤ 300 (A demand), X_2 ≤ 200 (B demand), X_1 and X_2 ≥ 0 (non-negativity), and a supply constraint. Each constraint represents a half plane in a two-dimensional space with X_1 and X_2. Intersection of five half planes forms a feasible region containing sets of X that satisfy all constraints. Aim to find X values within this region that will optimize the objective function.
