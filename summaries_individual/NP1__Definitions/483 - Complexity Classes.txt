NP is defined using search problems, differing from the traditional approach of using decision problems. Search problems can have solutions efficiently verified in polynomial time, regardless of how long it takes to generate a solution. In contrast, the class P consists of problems solvable in polynomial time. Since verifying a solution (as required by NP) is easier than finding one (as required by P), every problem in class P is also in NP, making P a subset of NP. The course will focus on search problems, not decision problems, aligning with the textbook used and simplifying the concept by eliminating the need for a witness in verifying solutions.
