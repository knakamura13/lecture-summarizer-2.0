The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem is in the complexity class NP because a given solution—a tree T—can be verified efficiently. The problem inherently has a solution since there must always be a minimum weight spanning tree for any given graph G. To confirm T is a solution to the MST problem, we check two things: T is a tree using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), ensuring it connects the graph G without cycles. Then we verify that T is of minimum weight by comparing it with the output of Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm. Since both BFS/DFS and Kruskal's/Prim's can be executed in polynomial time, specifically O(N+M) and O(MlogN) respectively, the verification process for T as an MST takes O(MlogN) time overall. This quick verification confirms the MST problem's placement in NP.
