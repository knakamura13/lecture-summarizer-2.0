00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,735
 Here is one of our earlier examples of an LP.

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:06,270
 This LP had three variables X_1, X_2,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,580
 X_3 and four constraints,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,050
 and the non-negativity constraints.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,300
 Now this was an example where we illustrate the simplex algorithm on and we found that

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,225
 the optimal value was achieved at this vertex (200, 200, 100).

7
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:23,490
 And when you plug in this point into the objective function,

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,330
 the profit, the value of the objective function is 2400.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,250
 Now suppose somebody simply gives us this point and claims that it's optimal.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,130
 Is there some way that we can verify that this point is in fact an optimal solution?

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,875
 So what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to upper bound the profit,

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,595
 we're going to try to upper bound

13
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:47,545
 this objective function and show that the profit is at most 2400.

14
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,815
 How are we going to achieve an upper bound on this objective function?

15
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:53,665
 Well, we know that these constraints are all satisfied.

16
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:57,150
 So we're going to take linear combinations of these constraints and

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,150
 then try to achieve an upper bound on this objective function.
