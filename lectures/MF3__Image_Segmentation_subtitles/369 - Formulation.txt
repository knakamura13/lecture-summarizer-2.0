We are going to view the images lying on a graph with the vertices of a graph correspond to the pixels of the image. So let us look at an example of a pixelated image. Here is an example of a small pixelated image magnified. The input is going to be specified by an undirected graph G. The vertices of the graph once again correspond to the pixels of the image. So there are nine vertices in this example and the edges will go between neighboring pixels.
