SAT is NP-complete because it fulfills two criteria: first, solutions can be verified efficiently, placing it within the class NP, and second, it's considered the most difficult problem in NP, as an efficient solution to SAT would translate to efficient solutions for all NP problems. This latter aspect is due to the possibility of transforming any NP problem into a SAT problem, which means solving SAT in polynomial time implies the same for the entire NP class. If P â‰  NP, which many believe, then no polynomial time algorithm exists for SAT, because such an algorithm would resolve all NP problems efficiently, thus proving P = NP and garnering significant recognition and awards for the solver. To establish SAT's NP-completeness, reductions from other NP problems like MST and coloring problems to SAT need to be formalized, demonstrating how these can be transformed and solved using an efficient SAT algorithm, if one exists.
