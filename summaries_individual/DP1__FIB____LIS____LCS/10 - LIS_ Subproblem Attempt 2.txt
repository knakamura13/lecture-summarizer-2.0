Introduced new subprob formula involving L(i) denoting longest inc subseq length incl a_i. Key addition: a_i must be in subseqs considered. Can express L(i) recurrence using L_1 to L_(i-1). Example given: L(1) = 1 (single element, 5), L(2) = 2 (5, 7 subseq), diverges at L(3) with length 1 (only 4), L(4) = 1 (only -3), L(5) = 3 (5, 7, 9), L(6) = 2 (-3, 1), L(7) = 4 (5, 7, 9, 10). For complex L(10), only subseqs that end with elemnts a_i can append 8; select longest, add 1 for 8. Hence L(10) = 5, illustrates recurrence relation to solve L(i), relating back to previous L values.
