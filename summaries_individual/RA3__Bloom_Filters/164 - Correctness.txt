Algorithm's correctness for database queries examined. If an element (x) inserted into the db, k bits set to 1. Queries on x will always return "Yes" because bits go only from 0 to 1. For x not in db, falsely positive results can occur if all k bits for x are already set to 1 by other insertions. This happens when each bit of x, upon query, matches a bit set to 1 by another element's insertion. Robustness increases because false positives only happen when all k bits align by chance, unlike previous methods with one bit checked. However, there's an optimal k value. Too high, and too many bits are set to 1, increasing false positives. Too low, not enough bits are checked. The challenge is to determine this optimal k to minimize false positive rate and assess if the data structure is effective for use.
