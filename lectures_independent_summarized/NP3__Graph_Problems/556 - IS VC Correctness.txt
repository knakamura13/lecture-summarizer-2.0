Reduced independence set problem (ISP) to vertex cover problem (VCP) using graph G and goals—ISP goal as g to VCP budget b, where b = n - g. Solved VCP with solution s ≤ b. Complementary set S-bar returned as ISP solution for s as a vertex cover, implying S-bar is an independent set ≥ g. No VCP solution means no ISP solution, confirming the reduction's correctness. Proved VCP is NP-complete.
