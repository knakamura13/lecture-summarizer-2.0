1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
 The solution to this problem is 2,3,8,5,12.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,665
 To get the x cubed coefficient 5,

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,390
 we obtain it in the following way,

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,035
 multiplying 3x square by negative x,

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,060
 we get negative 3x cubed.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,670
 Multiplying 2x by 4x square, we get 8x cubed.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,670
 Adding these up, we get 5x cubed.
