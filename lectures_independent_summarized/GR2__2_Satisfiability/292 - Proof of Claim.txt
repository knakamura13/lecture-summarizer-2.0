To prove that a path from alpha to beta guarantees a path from beta bar to alpha bar and vice versa, consider a path via vertices gamma0 (alpha) to gammal (beta). For any edge between two points, say gamma1 to gamma2, derived from the clause gamma1 bar or gamma2, there's also an edge from gamma2 bar to gamma1 bar. Following this for each segment, a path is constructed from gammal bar (beta bar) to gamma0 bar (alpha bar). This symmetry is reversible. Exhibiting this proves the correctness of the linear time algorithm for 2-SAT.
