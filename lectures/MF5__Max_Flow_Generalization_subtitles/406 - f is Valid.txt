Now we know that f is feasible. What does that mean? That means that the flow along this edge E is at least its demand. Now f-prime along this edge E is defined to be f along this edge minus the demand. So since this is true, we have the flow f-prime along this edge is at least zero. So f-prime is non-negative. Similarly, we have that f is at most its capacity. Therefore, f-prime is at most the capacity minus the demand which is the definition of the capacity in this network G-prime. So we know that this new flow f-prime that we constructed is non-negative and satisfies the capacity constraints. Now we simply have to check that f-prime satisfies the flow in equals the flow out constraint.
