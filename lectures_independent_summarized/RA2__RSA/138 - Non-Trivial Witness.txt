A trivial Fermat witness is a number z that shares a non-trivial divisor with a composite number r, immediately indicating r is not prime without needing Fermat's test. All composite numbers have trivial Fermat witnesses since they have non-trivial divisors. The presence of a non-trivial Fermat witness, which is relatively prime to r, however, is significant. While some composite numbers, called pseudo primes, lack non-trivial Fermat witnesses, most have at least one; when one exists, many exist, making them easy to detect. This abundance of non-trivial Fermat witnesses is crucial for developing effective primality testing algorithms.
