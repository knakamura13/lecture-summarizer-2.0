The solution is linear time. It takes O(n+m) time to check whether a particular flow f is maximum or not. This follows as a consequence of the lemma we stated on the previous slide. For a flow f*, if there's no augmenting path, no path from s to t in the residual graph for this particular flow, then this flow f* is a max-flow. So to check whether f is a max-flow, we build its residual graph which takes linear time, O(n+m) time, and then we check for a path from s to t in this residual graph. To do that, we simply run DFS from s to check whether t is reachable from s. What this lemma says is if there is no path from s to t in this residual graph, then this particular flow f is a max-flow. So we output yes. Now what if there is a path from s to t? Well, then we can augment a flow along this path. And then we get a flow of larger value. And therefore, this particular flow f is not a max-flow because we can build a flow of larger size. Now we'll get back to the proof of this lemma shortly. But let's go back first to the max-flow min-cut theorem, and let's see what min-cut actually means.
