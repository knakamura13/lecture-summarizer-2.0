Examining lemma related to clause Cj of size K, with literals in positive form. Simplified case to be generalized later. LP constraint established where "if all literals false then variable Zj_hat_star = 0." For randomized rounding, assessing prob. that Cj satisfied, which equals 1 - prob. of Cj being unsatisfied. This is further calculated as 1 - prod. of (1 - Yi_hat_star) for each variable. Lemma aims to show prob. of Cj satisfaction is at least 1 - (1/E) times Zj_hat_star. Sum of Yi's linked to Zj_hat_star, lemma seeks to connect prod. of Yi's to this sum using the geometric mean-arithmetic mean inequality.
