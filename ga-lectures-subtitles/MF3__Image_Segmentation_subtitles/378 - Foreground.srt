1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,565
 So, we're going to add a vertex S,

2
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:06,190
 a source vertex, corresponding to the foreground pixels.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,130
 Now, here's the same directed graph, once again,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,690
 with the vertices shrunk a little bit,

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,770
 just for illustrative purposes.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,785
 Now, we're going to add two additional vertices,

7
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,440
 S and t. S will correspond to the foreground,

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,605
 t will correspond to the background,

9
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:22,305
 and this will be our source and our sync for our max-flow problem.

10
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:26,900
 We're going to add an edge from S to every pixel, every vertex.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,775
 So, for every pixel in the original undirected graph,

12
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:32,325
 we add an edge from S to i.

13
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,865
 Now, S is supposed to correspond to the foreground.

14
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,735
 So, the capacity of this edge will be fi.

15
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:37,735
 So, we encode the foreground likelihoods.
