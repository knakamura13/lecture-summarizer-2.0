Divide and Conquer (D&C) algorithms, such as binary search or merge sort, demonstrate their power in handling complex large-scale problems which are beyond the capacity of hardware implementations. Addressing multiplication of two n-bit numbers, often running into thousands of bits as in RSA encryption, D&C offers a faster solution than standard methods. This approach also solves finding the median in an unsorted array without sorting it. Additionally, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, a cornerstone in fields like signal processing and hailed as a pivotal numerical tool since 1994, hinges on understanding complex numbers. Despite the initial complexity, mastering FFT reveals its elegance and simplicity, and investing time and effort in learning it proves rewarding, as it is considered a masterpiece in the realm of algorithms.
