The plus-minus property indicates first n points are the inverse of the subsequent n points, aiding in recursive computation of polynomial A(x) at 2n points. By evaluating A(x) at points xi and xn+i, leveraging the plus-minus principle, we find that these points are opposites. Splitting A(x) into even and odd terms, we find even terms consistent for xi and -xi, due to even powers, but the odd terms differ, as odd powers result in opposite values for xi and xn+i. This leads to the division of A(x) into even (a_even) and odd coefficients (ai), facilitating the handling of the polynomial's coefficients.
