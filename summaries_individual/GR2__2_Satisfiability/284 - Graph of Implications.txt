Converting a Boolean logic problem with a formula F consisting of variables and clauses into a graph problem. In the formula, let N = number of variables (X1, ..., XN) and M = number of clauses. Construct a directed graph to represent the problem. The graph will have 2N vertices, one for each literal and its negation (X1, X1 Bar, ..., XN, XN Bar), and 2M edges, representing implications derived from the clauses (a clause of literals alpha and beta yields edges from Alpha Bar to beta and from Beta Bar to alpha). Example: a formula with 3 variables/clauses generates a graph with 6 vertices and edges that encode implications such as setting X1 true requires X2 to be false to satisfy the clause X1 Bar or X2 Bar, visualized as directed edges (X1 to X2 Bar, X2 to X1 Bar). The graph construction generalizes to any formula with clauses of two literals.
