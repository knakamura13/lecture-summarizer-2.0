In a given state transition system, starting from state two at time zero, the distribution of states at time t=1 can be found by referencing the second row of the transition matrix or by multiplying a vector with a one in the second entry by the matrix. The distribution at any time can be a vector (M) representing the probability over multiple states, summing to one. This initial distribution M0, when multiplied by the transition matrix P, yields the subsequent distribution M1 at t=1. However, for a stationary distribution π, once reached, the system remains in that distribution regardless of the step taken; thus, πP = π, indicating that π is an eigenvector of transition matrix P with an eigenvalue of one, designating it as the principal eigenvector. The setup assumes a unique stationary distribution by considering matrices with at most one eigenvector with eigenvalue one.
