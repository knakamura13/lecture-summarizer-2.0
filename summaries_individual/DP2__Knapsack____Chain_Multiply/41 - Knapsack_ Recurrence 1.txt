K(i) represents the maximum value achieved from a subset of the first i objects, aiming to establish a recurrence relation for K(i) based on smaller subproblems. Using an example with objects valued at 15, 10, 8, and 1 and weights 15, 12, and 5 accordingly, K(1) equals 15 by including the first object. For K(2), choosing between objects 1 and 2 favors object 1, as their combined weight exceeds the limit. K(3)'s optimal value of 18 involves objects 2 and 3, yet K(3) can't be derived from K(1) or K(2). Instead, it uses a suboptimal solution from K(2) that allows spare capacity for object 3. To integrate object 3, the solution must consider the remaining capacity reduced by object 3's weight. This evidence suggests subproblems must account for a prefix of objects and adjust available capacity, leading to the need for a revised dynamic programming algorithm approach.
