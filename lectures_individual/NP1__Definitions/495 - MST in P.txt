Now, we just saw that the MST problem is an NP. So, we've seen that MST is a search problem. Now, let's prove that MST is in P. And to show that the MST problem is in P, there's two parts. First, we have to show that the MST problem is a search problem. Well, that's what we just did to show that MST is an NP. So we've done that first part. The second part is to show that we can find a solution in polynomial time. How do we find a solution in polynomial time? We simply use Kruskal or Prim's algorithm. This shows the second part. So this completes the proof that MST is NP.
