1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,286
 Now our goal is to reduce this problem,

2
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:05,815
 this maximisation problem, to the min st-cut problem.

3
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:11,035
 So we have to somehow change this maximisation problem into a minimization problem.

4
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:13,005
 So we are going to have to modify these weights.

5
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:17,120
 And the other issue is that we are summing some terms and we are subtracting other terms.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,380
 Now all of these parameters are non-negative.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,225
 In our min st-cut problem,

8
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:25,920
 all the capacities in the input flow network are all positive.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,530
 So we somehow need to change this minus of the separation penalty into an addition,

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,530
 so that all the terms are positive or non-negative.
