1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
 This solution is omega sub n to the n minus 2.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,800
 If I multiply omega sub n square times omegas sub n to the n minus 2,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,130
 we get omega sub n to the nth power which is one.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,320
 Similarly, in polar coordinates,

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,185
 this number in polar coordinates is 1 comma two pi over n times 2.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,570
 This number is 1 comma two pi over n times and minus 2.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,685
 When we multiply we get 1 in the radius,

8
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:30,912
 we add up the angles so we get 2 pi over n times n.

9
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:36,010
 This is the same as 1 comma 2 pi which is 1.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,820
 So this verifies that the inverse of

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:38,820
 this number omega sub n squared is omega sub n to the n minus 2.
