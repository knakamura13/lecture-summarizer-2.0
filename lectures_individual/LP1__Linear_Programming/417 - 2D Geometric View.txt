let's take a look pictorially at these five constraints now once again we have two variables so we're in two-dimensional space now our first constraint says that x1 is a most 300 so we have this line x1 equals 300 and we're looking at the left side all points on the left side of this line the second constraint is that x2 is the most 200 so we're looking at our points below this line and we want points satisfying both constraints so we're looking at the points in the bottom left quadrant of these two vectors next we have the non-negative constraints putting in both non-negative constraints now we lie in this rectangle and then we have our final our fifth constraint which says that we lie on this side of this line hence this tan region is our feasible region all the points in this tan region in this convex polygon satisfy all five constraints
