Sum of foreground (FG) and background (BG) likelihoods across pixels denoted by L. Weight of a partition FB computed using FG weight (fi) per FG pixel and BG weight (bj) per BG pixel. Weight sum equals L minus FG pixels' BG likelihood sum and BG pixels' FG likelihood sum. Summing FG and BG pixels' FG likelihood gives total FG likelihood. Adding BG pixels' BG likelihood yields total BG likelihood. Upon subtracting edge separation penalty from both sides, equation represents weight W of FB. Define W-prime of FB comprising three terms, showing right-hand side equals L minus W-prime of FB.
