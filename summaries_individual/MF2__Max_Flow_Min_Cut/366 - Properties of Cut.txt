Examined properties of a constructed flow network example; identified capacities and flows (red/green numbers). Residual network lacks certain edges, reflecting flow and capacity utilization. Defined vertex set L as source-reachable in residual network, complement being set R, together creating ST cut LR. Notably, sink vertex T resides in R, confirming ST cut validity. Key residual network edge properties: 1. Edges leaving L to R (e.g., D -> T, D -> C, S -> C) are absent due to reachability contradiction; thus such edges are at full capacity in the original network. 2. Total flow departing L equals capacity from L to R, since all L to R edges are fully utilized. 3. Edges from R to L in original network (e.g., F -> E) carry zero flow in flow f* because corresponding reverse edges are absent in residual network, precluding flow into L. The observations yield that for ST cut LR, total flow out of set L matches LR's capacity, and total flow into L is zero. Concluding the flow f* equals the capacity of cut LR supports the max-flow min-cut theorem's proof.
