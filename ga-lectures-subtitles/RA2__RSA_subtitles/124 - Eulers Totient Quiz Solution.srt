1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,510
 Now, let's go ahead and look at what phi_of_n is for this case when n_equals_p_times_q.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,590
 Let's write out all the numbers that we're looking at.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,095
 We're looking at the numbers between one and p_times_q.

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,200
 So, this pq numbers here.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,695
 How many of these numbers are multiples of p?

6
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:18,990
 Well, p, two_times_p, up to q_times_p,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,580
 are all multiples of p. How many of those are there? There's q of them.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,610
 So, q are multiples of p. How many are multiples of q?

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,650
 There's q, two_times_q, up to p_times_q.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,730
 So, p of these numbers are multiples of q.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,805
 So, each of these numbers has a common divisor with p_times_q,

12
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:45,170
 namely p. And each of these numbers has a common divisor with p_times_q, namely q.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,040
 So, we have to exclude all these numbers.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,805
 So we had p_times_q numbers originally.

15
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,990
 Q of them are multiples of p,

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,375
 and p of them are multiples of q.

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,890
 And look, we double counted.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,940
 P times q is counted twice,

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,840
 so let's add one while I can.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,220
 This can be rewritten as p_minus_one_times_q_minus_one.

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,605
 So, what is phi_of_n for the case when n is p_times_q for prime numbers p and q?

22
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:08,605
 Is p_minus_one_times_q.
