1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,535
 Now here's what we just saw. We saw that if we did the random walk on the web graph,

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:09,740
 then a stationary distribution satisfies this identity.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,735
 And this is what we'd like to define the PageRank for this web page to be.

4
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,290
 First off, is this well defined?

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,930
 Think back to our discussion about Markov chains and

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,345
 about stationary distributions of Markov chains.

7
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,760
 What are some of the key issues that can arise when we talk

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,485
 about stationary distributions of Markov chains?

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,920
 Was there a unique stationary distribution or

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,410
 are there multiple stationary distributions?

11
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,330
 Well, if there are multiple stationary distributions

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,180
 and it's not clear which one we are referring to.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,210
 Also, we want that no matter where we start this random walk,

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,326
 we're always going to reach the stationary distribution.

15
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,600
 For instance, what if G has many strongly connected components?

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,845
 I mean, this is definitely the case.

17
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:51,055
 The web graph is going to have many strongly connected components.

18
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,905
 So, there might be one strongly connected component,

19
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:57,595
 very small strongly connected component containing my web page.

20
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:01,615
 And, perhaps, if you start the random walk in that strongly connected component,

21
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:06,390
 you might have a high probability of ending at my particular web page.

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,536
 Now, does that mean that I should have a high PageRank? Probably not.

23
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,840
 Now, there might be another strongly connected component,

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,408
 a very giant component and this giant component probably contains Google's web page.

25
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:21,730
 And now, if you start the random walk in that giant component,

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,380
 then you probably have a good probability of ending at Google's web page.

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,760
 So Google's web page should have

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,407
 a high PageRank because in that component it has a high rank.

29
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:35,930
 So how can we ensure that the Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution?

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,170
 We want to ensure that there's only one strongly connected component

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,140
 and also we want to get rid of any periodicity.

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,815
 There might be some parts of the graph which are bipartite.

33
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:47,640
 The easy way we discussed for making sure that there's

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,137
 a unique stationary distribution is to make the graph fully connected.

35
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,710
 So we're going to add edges,

36
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,795
 maybe with very small probability,

37
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:58,975
 but there will be edges between every pair of vertices.

38
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,250
 So, from any web page,

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,210
 we'll have some positive probability of going to any other particular web page.

40
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,910
 So, suppose your web browser had a random button.

41
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,335
 If you hit this random button,

42
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,025
 then it's going to take you to a random web page.

43
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:15,180
 The web page will be chosen uniformly at random from all web pages.

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,725
 So if there are a million web pages,

45
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:20,820
 you have probably one over a million of ending at any particular web page.

46
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,610
 Now, let's suppose you're surfing the web.

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,000
 What's the random walk going to look like?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,320
 So, with some probability you're going to follow a random outgoing link from

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,735
 the current web page and with some probability you're going to hit the random button.

50
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,950
 And that's going to take you to a random web page in the whole graph.

51
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,260
 So, that random button is going to make the graph fully connected.

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,260
 Let's formalize this random walk that we're talking about here.
