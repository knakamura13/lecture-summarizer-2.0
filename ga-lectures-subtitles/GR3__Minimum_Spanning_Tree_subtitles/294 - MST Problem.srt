00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
 The input to the minimum spanning tree problem,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,350
 also known as the MST problem,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,375
 is an undirected graph, G,

4
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:10,375
 and each edge, E, has a weight w(e).

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:14,985
 Our goal is to find the subgraph of minimal size which is still connected.

6
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:18,410
 Now the connected subgraph of minimal size is of course a tree.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,810
 We call it a spanning tree to stress the fact that it's connected,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,940
 that it's a tree and not a forest.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,160
 And we want to find such a subgraph of minimum weight.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,090
 In summary, our goal is to find the minimum weight spanning tree of

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,545
 G. And just to remind you what do we mean by minimum weight,

12
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,475
 well, for a particular tree, T,

13
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:35,475
 its weight is the sum of the weights of the edges in that tree.
