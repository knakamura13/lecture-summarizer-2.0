We're exploring a generalized max-flow problem with added demand constraints for each edge. In this revised flow network, both capacities and demands define each edge, with the new aim to identify a feasible flow that meets or exceeds these demands while complying with the standard max-flow problem's constraints. The central question we're tackling is whether it's possible to satisfy all demands with a feasible flow within the network. Once established, we can then look to optimize the feasible flow to maximize its size.
