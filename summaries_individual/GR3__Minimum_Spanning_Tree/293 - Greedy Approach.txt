Examining greedy optimization, particularly whether local optimal moves yield global optima. Greedy failed for knapsack but succeeded for minimum spanning tree (MST) via Kruskal's algorithm, which will be emphasized for proof of correctness. Proof foundation lies in the cut property lemma, which guarantees Kruskal's efficacy for MSTs and also validates Prim's algorithm. Understanding the lemma's statement and proof provides insight into algorithm correctness. A review of MST problem formulation and cut property details underpins these algorithm validations, showing they both work effectively for MSTs.
