What's a simple idea for choosing this subset S, which is of size n over five? Well, perhaps the simplest idea is let the subset S just be the first n over five elements of A. Then we're going to set a pivot to be the median of this subset S. How does this pivot perform? Is it a good pivot? Is this pivot P a good pivot? No. Why not? Well, that would be too easy. Let's see why it fails. Let's see the scenario where this pivot P is not a good pivot. Well, suppose A was sorted. Well in this case, actually, it's easy to find the median of A. So, there's no reason we're running the whole algorithm. But suppose A is sorted and then, actually, this is going to imply that this pivot P is a bad pivot. So if A is sorted, then what is S? S is going to be the first n over five elements of A. So it's the smallest elements of A. So S contains all the n over five smallest elements of A. What is the median of these n over five smallest elements of A? The median of the n over five smallest elements is the n over 10th smallest element. So this pivot is the n over 10th smallest element of this list A. Well if this is the n over 10th smallest element. Then when we partition A into the small, equal and big sets, the big set all we can guarantee is that it's at most nine-tenths n. And then if you go back to the running time of our algorithm, then we're going to have t of n is at most t of nine-tenths n instead of three-fourths n. So this pivot P is not a good pivot, because this large set is going to be too large in the worst case. So is there a better choice for this set S? Well, there's some hope because we chose this set S right now without looking at A at all. So, can we look at A and do a little bit of computation and choose a better representative set S?
