00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 Let's take a look at an example to make sure you're okay with the terminology.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,700
 Here's an example with two strings of length seven.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,290
 Let's do a quick check to make sure you understand the problem definition.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,513
 In this example, what's the longest common subsequence?

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,200
 Go ahead and mark the longest common subsequence

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,200
 in this example and also indicate the length of it.
