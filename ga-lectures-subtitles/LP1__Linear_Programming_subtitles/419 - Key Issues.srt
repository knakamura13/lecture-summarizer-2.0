1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,215
 Before moving on, let's use this simple example to identify a few important issues.

2
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:08,010
 The first and perhaps the most important issue is that

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,241
 we're optimizing over this entire feasible region,

4
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:12,675
 this tan set here.

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,415
 Now in this example the optimum happened be at an integer point,

6
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,830
 this point 100, 200.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,215
 So x_1 and x_2 are integer values,

8
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:26,490
 but we have no way to only consider solutions lying on integer points.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,580
 We can only find the best point in this whole region.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,100
 For example, for a different objective function,

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,195
 the optimum may lie at this vertex. At this vertex.

12
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:37,810
 X_1 is an integer value,

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,460
 it's 300, but X_2 is a fractional value.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,990
 In such a scenario,

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,765
 what do we do if we only want to consider integer points

16
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,370
 such as in our example for the production situation?

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,195
 Well, if we end up with a fractional point,

18
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:52,650
 which is the optimal point,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,195
 we could try to round it to an integer point.

20
00:00:55,195 --> 00:01:00,525
 That's something we'll do in the lecture LP four on the Max-set Approximation Algorithm.

21
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:03,510
 The key point is that linear programming optimizes over

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,590
 this entire set and when we optimize over this entire set,

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,635
 then the problem is polynomial time solvable.

24
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:15,570
 So, linear programming LP is in the complexity class P. Now,

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,185
 the corresponding problem where we look for the best integer valued solution

26
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:23,500
 is called integer linear programming and is denoted as ILP.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,270
 The ILP problem is NP-complete.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,395
 So it's unlikely that we can solve it in polynomial time.

29
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,485
 We'll see this fact that ILP is

30
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:35,400
 NP-complete in the Max-set Approximation Algorithm lecture.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,370
 Another key idea is that the optimal point for

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,180
 this linear program lies at a vertex of this polygon.

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,795
 What does a vertex mean? A vertex means a corner of this polygon.

34
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:49,455
 So, there are five vertices of this polygon: one,

35
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:54,190
 two, three, four, and five.

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,820
 Why is it the case that the optimum must lie at

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,120
 a vertex of this polygon of this feasible region?

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,300
 Now, it may be the case that other points are also optimal.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,105
 We're just saying that vertices are at least as good as any other point.

40
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:10,060
 Look at this line for the max C achievable.

41
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,500
 In this case, C equals 1300.

42
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,090
 Suppose this optimal line intersects a point such as

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,095
 this point Z which is not a vertex of this polygon.

44
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:21,710
 Well, this point Z lies on on edge of the polygon.

45
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,940
 Therefore, it must be the case that one of

46
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,035
 these two endpoints of this edge must be better than this point Z,

47
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:32,820
 or it has to be the case that this optimal line intersects this edge.

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,860
 If this optimal line intersects this edge,

49
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,865
 then all the points on this edge are optimal.

50
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,790
 Therefore, the two endpoints are both optimal and

51
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,320
 therefore an optimal point lies at a vertex.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,845
 The last important concept is convexity.

53
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:52,205
 This feasible region, this tan region is convex.

54
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,480
 What exactly does convexity mean?

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,370
 Well, if we take any two points in this set and we look at the line connecting them,

56
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,870
 then that entire line,

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,850
 that entire edge is contained in this set.

58
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,520
 This means that we don't have a shape like this.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,370
 The feasible region can't go down and then back up because if we take a point over

60
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,360
 here and a point over here and we look at the line,

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,785
 the edge connecting them,

62
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,800
 then it goes outside the set.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,720
 So this is non-convex set.

64
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,425
 Because the feasible region is defined by the intersection of half spaces,

65
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,610
 it must be a convex set.

66
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,415
 We can't get these nasty shapes.

67
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:35,395
 Since it's convex, if we have a vertex such as this point,100, 200,

68
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,665
 which is better than its neighbors,

69
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,070
 these two points, well,

70
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,950
 the feasible region can't go down and then back up.

71
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,215
 So, if this point is better than its neighbors,

72
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,150
 then the entire convex region,

73
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,570
 the entire feasible region is below these two lines.

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,640
 Therefore, this point is optimal because if a point is better than its neighbors,

75
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,555
 then that vertex is an optimal point.

76
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,635
 That's the key point of convexity,

77
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:05,375
 the optimal point always lies at a vertex of this feasible region.

78
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,820
 There may be other points which are optimal, for example,

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,950
 this entire line might be optimal,

80
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,310
 but there always is a vertex of this feasible region.

81
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,370
 In this case, these two points which will be optimal.

82
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,880
 This concept that an optimal point lies at a vertex of

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,985
 the polygon and the key fact that if a vertex is better than all of its neighbors,

84
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:28,530
 then its' therefore the global optima.

85
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,060
 This leads to the simplex algorithm which we'll detail later,

86
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,090
 but let's give a brief sketch of it.

87
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,115
 It's sort of a local greedy approach.

88
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:38,870
 We'll start at some vertex of the polygon.

89
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,995
 We'll check its neighbors and we'll look if any of its neighbors are better.

90
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:44,690
 Then we'll move to a neighbor which has

91
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,770
 a better objective function and we continue until we find

92
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,710
 a vertex of the polygon in the feasible region which is

93
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,255
 better than all of its neighbors and therefore it's optimal.

94
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,890
 That's the basic idea of the simplex algorithm.

95
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:57,890
 Now let's move on to another three dimensional example.
