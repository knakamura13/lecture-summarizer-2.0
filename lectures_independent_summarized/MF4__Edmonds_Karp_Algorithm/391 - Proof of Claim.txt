Vertex levels in the Edmonds-Karp algorithm remain stable or increase, never decrease. Levels might seem to drop if a shorter path appears, but this is discounted by edge removals; focus is on edge additions. Analyzing a Y-to-Z edge addition, the reverse must be part of the augmenting path (by BFS properties, every subsequent vertex level is one higher than the previous). Given Z's level is i, Y's is i+1, making the Y-to-Z addition from higher to lower level, not reducing Z's level. Hence, vertex levels remain constant or rise with each algorithm round, refuting the possibility of level decrease. The proof underscores this stability while hinting at a bound on algorithm rounds derived from occasional strict level increases.
