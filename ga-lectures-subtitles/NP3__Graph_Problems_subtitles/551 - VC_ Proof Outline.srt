1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
 to prove that the vertex cover problem

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,500
 is np-complete there are two parts the

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,240
 first part once again is to prove that

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,940
 it's in the class and P so consider an

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,920
 input to the vertex cover problem a

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,400
 graph capital G and a budget little B

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,460
 and consider a proposed solution capital

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,189
 S this is a proposed vertex cover in the

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,100
 graph G can we verify in polynomial time

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,710
 that ass is a vertex cover of requisite

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,310
 size in the input graph G first in order

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,679
 to verify that s is a vertex cover we

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,940
 have to check every edge of the graph

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,550
 and we have to check that at least one

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,489
 of the two endpoints is in set s this

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,379
 can be done in linear time in order n

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,960
 plus M time next we have checked that

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,809
 the set s is sufficiently small this can

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,610
 easily be done in linear time in order n

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,219
 time this shows that in polynomial time

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,949
 we can verify that s is a solution to

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,289
 this input instance now we can do the

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,420
 second more non-trivial aspect of the

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,250
 proof now we have to show that the

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,989
 vertex cover problem is at least as hard

26
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,589
 as every problem in the class NP so we

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,420
 have to take a known np-complete problem

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,340
 we now have four problems that we know

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,189
 are np-complete sad 3sat independent set

30
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,500
 and clique and we have to reduce one of

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,049
 them to the vertex cover problem it's

32
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,460
 most natural to take one of the graph

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,470
 problems either independent set or Klee

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,420
 these are quite similar to each other so

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,280
 it doesn't matter too much we're gonna

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,170
 take independent set problem and reduce

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,420
 it to the vertex cover problem now let's

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,920
 do the reduction from the independent

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:28,920
 set problem to the vertex cover problem
