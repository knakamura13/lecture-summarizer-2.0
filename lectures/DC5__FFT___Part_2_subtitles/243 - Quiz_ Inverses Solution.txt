This solution is omega sub n to the n minus 2. If I multiply omega sub n square times omegas sub n to the n minus 2, we get omega sub n to the nth power which is one. Similarly, in polar coordinates, this number in polar coordinates is 1 comma two pi over n times 2. This number is 1 comma two pi over n times and minus 2. When we multiply we get 1 in the radius, we add up the angles so we get 2 pi over n times n. This is the same as 1 comma 2 pi which is 1. So this verifies that the inverse of this number omega sub n squared is omega sub n to the n minus 2.
