1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
 Now another pitfall that can happen is if

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,370
 our underlying graph has multiple strongly connected components,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,050
 for example in this graph,

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,330
 there are three strongly connected components.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,740
 Now look, if we start at one of

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,335
 these three vertices we're only going to reach these three vertices.

7
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:15,870
 If we start at one of these two vertices,

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,730
 we only reach these two vertices.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,860
 So the starting state definitely matters.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,800
 What we would like is that the graph has one strongly connected component.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,210
 The terminology for this is that P is irreducible.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,775
 If the graph has one strongly connected component,

13
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:33,713
 every pair of vertices are strongly connected with each other,

14
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:37,230
 then the transition matrix is irreducible.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,990
 Now what's an easy way to assure that the graph is one strongly connected component,

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,285
 while connect up every pair of vertices.

17
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:45,310
 So make it the complete graph.

18
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,060
 For all pairs of states i and j,

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,565
 we make the entry p (ij) be strictly greater than zero.

20
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:56,550
 So there's a positive probability of going between every pair of vertices.

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,890
 The matrix P is all positive,

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,289
 and therefore the graph is fully connected,

23
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,400
 so it's one strongly connected component.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,630
 This is the easiest way to ensure that the graph is

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,630
 one strongly connected component and therefore irreducible.
