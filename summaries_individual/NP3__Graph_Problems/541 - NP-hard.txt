The independent set problem is NP-complete, confirmed through a reduction from all problems in NP class to it, indicating its equal or greater difficulty. Max Independent Set Problem, its optimization version, is not confirmed to be in NP but is reducible from the independent set problem, signifying it's at least as hard as any NP problem. If Max Independent Set were in NP, it'd be NP-complete, but its classification is currently NP-hard. This reflects its comparative difficulty level: NP-hard indicates that solving it would enable solving all NP problems in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are the most challenging in NP, being both NP-hard and inside the NP class.
