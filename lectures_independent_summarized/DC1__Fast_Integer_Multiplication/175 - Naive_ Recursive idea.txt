Recursive approach to multiply n-bit numbers x and y by splitting each into two n/2-bit numbers: xl (first n/2 bits of x), xr (last n/2 bits of x), yl (first n/2 bits of y), and yr (last n/2 bits of y). x equals xl * 2^(n/2) + xr and y equals yl * 2^(n/2) + yr. Multiplying x and y yields 2^n * xl * yl + 2^(n/2) * (xl * yr + yl * xr) + xr * yr. To compute x * y, recursively compute products of n/2-bit numbers: xl * yl, xl * yr, xr * yl, and xr * yr, leading to a recursive algorithm for the larger product. This method needs refinement for efficiency.
