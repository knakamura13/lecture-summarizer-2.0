Ford-Fulkerson algorithm applied to Max flow problem on flow network, directed graph G with source (S) and sink (T) vertices, plus edges with given positive capacities. For analysis, usually presuppose integer capacities; This condition temporarily disregarded for general problem. Max flow problem's goal: determine maximum flow from S to T. Running time analyzed, but not maximum size proof of flow generated by Ford-Fulkerson. Stopping condition: no augmenting path in residual graph G^(f*), from S to T. Lack of augmenting path signifies no further flow increase possible, confirming the flow as Max flow. Thus, the absence of a S-T path in the residual graph proves that the current flow is the maximum possible.
