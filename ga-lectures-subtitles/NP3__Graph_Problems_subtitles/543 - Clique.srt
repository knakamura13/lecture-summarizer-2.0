00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
 A clique is a fully connected subgraph.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,560
 Let me define it more formally for you.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,265
 The clique problem is defined for undirected graphs.

4
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:11,220
 So, let's consider an undirected graph G. Here's

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,925
 an example of an undirected graph that we'll use to illustrate a clique.

6
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:19,380
 A subset S of vertices is a clique if the following holds,

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,500
 for all pairs of vertices in this subset,

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,900
 say the pair is X and Y,

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,405
 then X and Y are connected by an edge.

10
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:31,430
 So, all pairs of vertices in this subset S are connected by an edge.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,430
 Here's an example of a clique of size five in this graph.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,100
 Notice that all five choose two pairs are connected by an edge.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,065
 And in fact, this is the largest clique in this graph.

14
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,810
 This vertex can almost be added to

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,080
 the clique but it's not connected to this vertex over here.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,960
 The challenging problem is to find large cliques.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,210
 Why is that the case?

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,695
 Well, very small cliques are trivial to find.

19
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:57,240
 For example, the empty set of vertices is always a trivial clique.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,255
 Moreover, any singleton vertex by itself is also a clique.

21
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:03,025
 And if you take any edge,

22
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:05,660
 the two endpoints of the edge form a clique.

23
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,080
 So very small cliques are easy to find.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,080
 The difficult problem is to find the largest clique or the clique of maximum size.
