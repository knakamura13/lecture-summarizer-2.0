We just saw how to show that the independent set problem is NP-complete. Now that reduction was quite interesting since it involved a reduction from SAT, which is a logic problem, to this graph problem, Independent sets. Now, will show that the Clique problem and vertex cover problem are NP-complete. These will be much easier since we now have a graph problem, independent sets to start from. Let's dive into the clique problem.
