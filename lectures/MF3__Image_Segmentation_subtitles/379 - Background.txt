Now for the background, we do similar, using this vertex t. So, we have an edge from every vertex of the original undirected graph to t. So these edges are going to T, whereas edges came out of S. So S was a source and T is a sync, and the capacity of these edges two t will be the background likelihood. So now we've got the foreground likelihood and the background likelihood encoded, and we have the separation penalties encoded. So here's our final graph, and we've specified the capacities along every edge. Therefore, we've defined a flow network, and we can use this as our input to the max-flow problem.
