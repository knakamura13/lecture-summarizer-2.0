In addressing the Max-SAT problem, define M* as the maximum number of clauses satisfiable within a given formula F, which contains M clauses. Create algorithm A that, upon inputting formula F, yields an assignment meeting L clauses. Aim to assure that L â‰¥ M*/2, establishing A as a one-half approximation algorithm for Max-SAT, where L represents the achievement of the formula under algorithm A compared to the optimum M*. Later discussions will target improving this to a three-quarters approximation algorithm.
