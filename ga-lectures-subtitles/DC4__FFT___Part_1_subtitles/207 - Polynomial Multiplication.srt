00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
 What we've seen so far is how to use divide and conquer in

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,405
 a clever way to multiply large integers.

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:08,280
 So for N bit integers,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,570
 we were able to multiply,

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,870
 compute their product in time better than order n square.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,335
 A similar idea applies to matrices as well.

7
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:18,398
 What we're going to do now is multiply polynomials.

8
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:20,430
 And to do this, we're going to use the beautiful divide and

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,325
 conquer algorithm known as FFT.

10
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:26,630
 FFT stands for fast fourier transform.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,230
 So here's the set up. We have a pair of polynomials A of X and B of X.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,330
 For the polynomial A of X,

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,760
 will denote its coefficients as A knot, A1,

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,845
 A2 up to An minus one.

15
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:41,545
 So it's of degree at most n minus one.

16
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:45,230
 And for B of X, will denote its coefficients as B knot,

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,510
 B1 up to Bn minus one.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,300
 And it also is of degree of most n minus one.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,730
 Our goal is to compute the product polynomial,

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,745
 C of X which is A of X times B of X.

21
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:58,760
 And the coefficient of C of X will denote as C knot,

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,835
 C1 up to C2 n minus two.

23
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:05,270
 Since the degree of C of X is at most two n minus two.

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,205
 Now recall that the Kth coefficient of the polynomial C of X,

25
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:15,795
 so this is denoted by c sub k. This is obtained by taking the constant term for A of X,

26
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:21,830
 this is A knot times the coefficient for the Kth term of B of X, this is BK.

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,190
 So I look at A knot times BK and I add that to

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,020
 the other possibilities A1 X Bk minus 1 and so on,

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,235
 up to a Nk times B knot.

30
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,810
 We want to solve the following computational problem.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,200
 We're given the vector of coefficients defining

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,960
 A of X and we're given the vector of coefficients

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
 defining B of X and we want to compute the vector of

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,285
 coefficients for the product polynomial C of X.

35
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:49,545
 Now this vector C is known as the convolution of A and B.

36
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:49,545
 So this star symbol denotes the convolution.
