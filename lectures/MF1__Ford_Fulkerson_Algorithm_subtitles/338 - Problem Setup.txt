The general setting is that we're sending supply from vertex s to vertex t. Now, what does this supply? The supply might be things like Internet traffic, or it might be a product. Now, the network is specified by a directed graph, and we have a designated start vertex s, and we have a designated end vertex t. And our goal is to maximize the amount of supply sent from s to t along the edges of this network, but we don't want to exceed the capacities of the edges. So, for each edge we have a capacity of that edge. If you think of supply as an example such as Internet traffic then the capacity corresponds to the bandwidth of the link. If you think of a more physical example such as supply being oil, then we're maximizing the amount of oil sent from point s to point t in this network. And then the edges correspond to actual pipes, and then these numbers correspond to the capacity of these pipes.
