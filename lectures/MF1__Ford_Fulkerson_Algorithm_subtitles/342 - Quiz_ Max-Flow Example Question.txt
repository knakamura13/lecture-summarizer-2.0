To make sure you understand the formulation of the max-flow problem, let's take a look back at our earlier example. So here's a flow network with a specified start and end vertex, and we specified the capacity for every edge. Now specify a flow. So for specify the flow along every edge where this flow is of maximum size and the flow needs to be valid, so it needs to satisfy the two constraints, which are the capacity constraints along every edge and the conservation of flow along every vertex except for S and T.
