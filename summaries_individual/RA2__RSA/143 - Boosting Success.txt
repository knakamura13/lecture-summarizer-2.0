Our original primality testing algorithm had a max false positive rate of ½. To reduce this rate, we now select K random numbers from 1 to R-1 and run a Fermat test on each. If any chosen number is a Fermat witness (its R-1 power is not congruent to 1 mod R), R is composite. If all numbers pass, R is likely prime. The probability of a composite R being incorrectly identified as prime (false positive) is at most ½^K. By choosing K=100 from a large set, the false positive probability is significantly reduced to ½^100, making the chance of an incorrect prime identification negligibly small and acceptable for cryptographic applications, assuming R is not a Carmichael number. Dealing with Carmichael numbers requires a slightly different approach, which is explained in the textbook.
