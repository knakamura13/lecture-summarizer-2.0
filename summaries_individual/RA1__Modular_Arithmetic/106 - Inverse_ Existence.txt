In the context of modular arithmetic, an entity X has a multiplicative inverse modulo another entity n (denoted by X inverse mod n) if and only if X and n are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is one. Multiplicative inverses do not exist when X and n share any common factor, evident when the GCD is greater than one. Two numbers are considered relatively prime if they share no common divisors, even if individually they are not prime numbers. The existence of an inverse in modular arithmetic is thus contingent upon this coprimality between X and n.
