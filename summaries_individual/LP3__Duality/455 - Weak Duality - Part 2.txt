Weak duality theorem implies: 1) If primal linear program (LP) is unbounded, then dual LP must be infeasibleâ€”this helps in determining if an LP is unbounded by first checking primal LP's feasibility, then dual LP's infeasibility. 2) Finding feasible points for both primal and dual LPs with matching objective function values guarantees their optimality, confirming X as optimal for primal and Y for dual. Example provided showed such an optimal Y. Optimal X and Y, with matching objective values, exist when both primal and dual LPs are bounded and feasible.
