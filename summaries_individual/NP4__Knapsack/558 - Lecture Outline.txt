SAT acknowledged as NP-complete; all NP problems reducible to SAT, thus solvable in polynomial time if SAT is. 3SAT also NP-complete, reduced from SAT. Independent Set problem declared NP-complete through reduction from 3SAT. Reduction notable: logic (3SAT) to graph (Independent Set) problem conversion. NP-completeness of Clique and Vertex cover problems established via simpler reductions from Independent Set. Aim to now prove NP-completeness of Knapsack problem, starting with proving Subset-sum problem NP-complete by reduction from 3SAT, marking a complex logic (3SAT) to optimization (Subset-sum) problem transformation. Following Subset-sum NP-completeness, Knapsack's NP-completeness proof deemed straightforward, set as homework. Prior study revealed a non-polynomial time Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Knapsack due to its dependency on N and B factors, the latter exponential relative to 3SAT input size, hence not polynomial. The clever reduction from 3SAT to Subset-sum (and Knapsack) highlights this complexity. Next, focus on defining and proving Subset-sum NP-completeness.
