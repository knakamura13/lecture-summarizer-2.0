Here's a basic fact that we're going to use repeatedly throughout our work. Let's say I have two numbers, x and y, which are congruent mod N. And I have two additional numbers, a and b, which are also congruent mod N. Now, the point is, that with respect to mod N, x and y are equivalent and a and b are equivalent. So, I can replace one by the other. More precisely, suppose I'm looking at x plus a mod N. Well, x is equivalent to y, so I can replace x by y, and a is equivalent by b, so, I can replace a by b. So, x plus a mod N, is congruent to y plus b mod N. I can replace x by y and a by b. Similarly, if I look at x times a mod N, instead of adding or multiplying, then I can do the same replacement operation. So x times a mod N, is congruent to y times b mod N. Now let's look at an example to illustrate the usefulness of this basic
