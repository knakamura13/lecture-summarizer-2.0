Checking if a flow f is maximum takes O(n+m) time based on the lemma that if no augmenting path exists in the residual graph from source s to sink t, flow f* is max. Construct the residual graph and run DFS from s to locate a path to t. No path means f is max-flow and output "yes." If a path is present, flow can be augmented, thus f isn't max-flow as a larger flow is possible. Further details on lemma proof and max-flow min-cut theorem to be revisited.
