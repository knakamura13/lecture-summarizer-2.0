So let's go ahead and prove the claim. So let's take a flow f* that has no augmenting path in this residual network and we wanted to find an s-t cut now. We want to use this property about this f*. We know there's no st-path in this residual network. So we know that t is not reachable from this vertex s in this graph. So that's a way to separate s from t. Therefore, we're going to let L be those vertices which are reachable from the vertex s in this residual network. Now we know this vertex t is not in this set L, why? Because we know there's no path from s to t in this residual network, that's our assumption about this flow f*. Therefore, we let R be the remaining vertices and we know that the vertex t is in this set R. So s is clearly reachable from itself. So s is in L and t is in R. So this set (L, R) is an s-t cut. So we've constructed our s-t cut, now we have to prove that this s-t cut has capacity which is equal to the size of this flow.
