1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
 What are the basic operations that our data structure is going to support?

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,080
 First operation is insert x.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,220
 So given a possible password X,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,650
 we want to add this password into our dictionary of unacceptable passwords.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,200
 The second operation is a query on X,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,150
 is this proposed password in our dictionary of unacceptable passwords?

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,410
 If this proposed password is in our dictionary of unacceptable passwords,

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,564
 then we're always going to output YES,

9
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,885
 so we're always correct in this case.

10
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:34,862
 The problem is that, when this proposed password is not in our dictionary,

11
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,535
 so it is an acceptable password,

12
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:42,055
 we usually output NO and we have to bound what we mean by usually.

13
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:44,880
 But occasionally, we're going to output YES.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,840
 So when in this proposed password is acceptable,

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,550
 occasionally we're going to have a false positive and say

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,962
 YES it is in the dictionary of unacceptable passwords,

17
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:56,010
 so this password is not allowed.

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,420
 So we have false positives with

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,420
 some small rate and we have to bound that rate and see what it looks like.
