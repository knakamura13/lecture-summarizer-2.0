Multiplying polynomials in value representation at 2n points enables computing the product polynomial C(x) efficiently; for each point, the computation is constant time, totaling linear, O(n), time. Polynomial C(x) results from products of corresponding values of polynomials A(x) and B(x), which can be done quickly since the degree of C(x) is at most 2n - 2, requiring at least 2n - 1 points. Utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we can transform from coefficients to values in O(n log n) time, multiply the polynomials in O(n) time, and convert the resulting values back to coefficients with another application of FFT, also in O(n log n) time. The whole process emphasizes the efficiency of polynomial multiplication in the values representation when paired with FFT.
