Completed the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm to multiply polynomials, specifically to compute the convolution of vectors A and B, representing polynomial coefficients. The goal is to obtain polynomial C which is the product of A and B, or their convolution. Given the degree of C is 2n-2, we need the polynomial evaluated at 2n-1 points. Padded vectors A and B with zeros to evaluate at 2n points using FFT, ensuring n is a power of 2. Upon obtaining A and B at the 2n roots of unity, used element-wise multiplication for these values, which requires constant time per element, resulting in C at the 2n roots of unity in linear time (order n). To retrieve coefficients from the values of C, implemented the inverse FFT, similar to the original FFT, achieving the necessary conversion.
