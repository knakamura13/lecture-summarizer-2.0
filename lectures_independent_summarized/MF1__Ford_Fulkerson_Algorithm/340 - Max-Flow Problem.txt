The max-flow problem involves determining the highest possible flow from a source vertex (s) to a sink vertex (t) in a directed graph that constitutes a flow network. Edges in this graph have assigned capacities (c_sub_e), and the flow (f_sub_e) on each edge must not surpass these capacities and must be non-negative. To satisfy conservation of flow, the input flow to any vertex (except s or t) must equal the output flow, ensuring no flow is lost or created within the network. Flow is computed as the sum of incoming flows (f_sub_wv) to vertex v and the sum of outgoing flows (f_sub_vz) from vertex v. Valid flow must adhere to both capacity and conservation constraints across the network.
