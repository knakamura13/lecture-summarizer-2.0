1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 Now, we just saw how to transform a clause of size 4 into a pair of clauses of size 3.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,935
 Now, let's try to generalize this idea.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,750
 Let's do it one step at a time.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,860
 So let's take a clause of size 5 now,

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,840
 and let's try to transform this into a triple of clauses of size 3.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,620
 Now, previously, to transform the clauses size 4 into a pair of clauses of size 3,

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,090
 we added one new variable y.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,195
 Now, to transform a clause of size 5 into triple clauses of size 3,

9
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,780
 we're going to create two new variables, y and z.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,100
 Now, we're going to make a formula, C prime,

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,010
 which is three clauses,

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,310
 and each of these clauses is going to be of size and most 3.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,960
 Actually, they're going to be a size equal to 3.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,175
 And we want to do this in such a way that C is satisfiable.

15
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,840
 The original clause C is satisfiable,

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,470
 if and only if this triple of clauses,

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,430
 C prime, is satisfiable.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,920
 And, therefore, in our original input F,

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,850
 if we have a clause such as this,

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,658
 we can replace it by this triple of clauses,

21
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:04,170
 and we'll get an equivalent formula.

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,895
 Now, the quiz is to define C prime.

23
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:08,480
 Define this triple of clauses,

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,125
 each is of size exactly three literals,

25
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,875
 and use this pair of new variables, y and z.

26
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,550
 For simplicity, for entering your solution,

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,755
 let me enter the or symbols for you.

28
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,175
 And also to simplify your input,

29
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,398
 let's relabel these literals.

30
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:28,200
 So let's relabel these five literals as a, b, c, d,

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,410
 e. So a is equal to X2 bar,

32
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,420
 b is equal to X3,

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,745
 c is equal to X1 bar,

34
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,773
 d is equal to X4 bar,

35
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:38,860
 e is equal to X5.

36
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,380
 So use a, b, c,

37
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,750
 d, e, and y and z,

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,572
 and create a formula, C prime,

39
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:49,825
 such that C Prim is satisfiable,

40
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:49,825
 if and only if C is satisfiable.
