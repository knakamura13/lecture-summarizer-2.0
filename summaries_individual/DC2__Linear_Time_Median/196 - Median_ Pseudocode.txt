Developed a linear time median algorithm, taking an unsorted array A of size n and an integer k to output the k-th smallest element. The process involves dividing A into groups of five elements, G_i, and sorting them to find median mi for each group. All group medians, set S, are collected, and its median (pivot P) is determined using a recursive call of the algorithm seeking the n/10-th smallest element in S. Using P to partition A into three subsets (smaller, equal, larger than P), the algorithm then applies a quick select process. The target k-th smallest element is found by recursively calling the algorithm on the appropriate subset (smaller or larger) or returning P if it lies within the equal subset. The algorithm's efficiency is predicated on the assumption of P being a good pivot, which is substantiated later in the analysis.
