1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,585
 This random walk that we just defined is a Markov chain.

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:08,000
 Let's look at the precise definition of the transition matrix for this Markov chain.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,765
 Let's let capital N denote the number of web pages.

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:14,840
 So this is the number of vertices in our directed graph.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,510
 This is going to be humongous.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,330
 Now, we have this transition matrix of size N by N.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,825
 Now, there are two cases,

8
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:25,160
 either Y to X is an edge in the original graph or it's not.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,320
 So let's look at these two cases separately.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,590
 Either Y to X is an edge in the original graph there's a hyperlink

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,355
 from Y to X or there's no hyperlink from Y to X.

12
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:36,860
 If there's no hyperlink from Y to X then the only way to go

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,250
 from Y to X is to use the random button.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,810
 What's the chance of that?

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,415
 Well, there's probability one minus Alpha that we hit the random button.

16
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,007
 Now when we hit the random button,

17
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,475
 we go to a random web page.

18
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:53,870
 So the probability of going to a particular web page is one over the number of web pages.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,905
 So it's one over capital N. So the chance of going from Y to X

20
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,270
 using the random button is one over capital N. So in this case,

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,930
 the probability of going from Y to X if there's no hyperlink from Y to

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,050
 X then it's one minus Alpha for hitting the random button.

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,640
 And then one over N is the probability of going to this particular web page X.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
 Now, if there is a hyperlink from Y to X,

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,660
 well we can still get from Y to X using the random button,

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,560
 probability of that is the same.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,700
 But we can also get from Y to X using the hyperlink.

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,725
 There's probability Alpha of following a random hyperlink.

29
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,700
 And given where in this case the probability of following

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,155
 a particular hyperlink is one over the number of hyperlinks.

31
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:39,390
 The number of hyperlinks at Y is the number of out neighbors of Y.

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,295
 Now, this transition matrix corresponds to a fully connected graph.

33
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:46,095
 Every pair of vertices has an edge.

34
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:48,800
 Now, the probability the weight of a particular edge might be very

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,545
 small but still there's an edge between every pair of vertices.

36
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,090
 So in our terminology from Markov chains this corresponds to

37
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,175
 an ergodic Markov chain which implies that there is a unique stationary distribution Pi.

38
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:04,250
 And regardless of where you start the random walk you always

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,415
 reach this stationary distribution in the limit over time.

40
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:12,200
 So the definition of this Pi is independent of the starting state of the random walk.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,905
 So this Pi is well defined.

42
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:19,800
 So we can set this Pi a stationary probability of web page X to be the PageRank,

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:19,800
 the importance of web page X.
