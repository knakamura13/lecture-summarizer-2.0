Directed graph connectivity determined using a DFS variant, capturing preorder and postorder numbers. DFS for undirected graphs revised by removing connected component tracking, focusing on vertex visitation times instead. Clock initialization at 1, recording visitation (preorder) and completion (postorder) times for vertices, informed by clock value which is incremented each step. Connectivity analysis relies primarily on postorder numbers, with preorder's usage less clear outside of academic testing scenarios. Algorithm adapted to account for directed graph properties.
