1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,685
 This particular input has a satisfying assignment.

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,140
 I can set x1 to true,

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,980
 x2 to false, x3 to false. Let's check it.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,765
 So for the first clause,

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,116
 I have that x2 is false,

6
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:14,690
 so this is our satisfied variable.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,660
 For the second clause, I have that x2 is true,

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,415
 so this is a satisfied literal.

9
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:22,260
 For the third clause, I have that x3 is false,

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,820
 so this is a satisfied literal.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,295
 For the last clause, I have that x3 is false,

12
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:28,005
 so this is a satisfied literal.

13
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:28,005
 So every clause has at least one literal satisfied.
