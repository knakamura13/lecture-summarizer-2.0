1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
 Now let's stick with our 6210 example,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,160
 and here's the transition matrix again for that 6010 example.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,780
 And now I want to look at powers of P. So I want to look at P to

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,670
 the K for big K and then we're going to

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,400
 see some interesting properties about this matrix.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,020
 Now once again what we saw before the square of this matrix,

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,320
 so P squared is this matrix.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,320
 Now let's look at it for big K. So let's look at it from P the 10 and P to the 20.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,150
 Now actually if you like to code up, you just code it up yourself.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,645
 Take this matrix and look at powers of it for big K,

11
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,415
 or take a different matrix.

12
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,980
 Make up a matrix and look at powers of it for

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,435
 big K. Just make sure that it's not stochastic matrix so each row sums to one,

14
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:41,515
 then it corresponds to a Markov chain.

15
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,840
 So this is the first row for P to the 10th.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,060
 And here's the second row.

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,030
 Notice that it's quite similar to the first row.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,250
 Is that just the fluke?

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,860
 Let's look at more rows to see whether that was

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,560
 just a fluke or it has some important properties.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,855
 Now the exact numbers in this matrix aren't important,

22
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,620
 but what's important is this interesting property that seems to be coming up.

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,065
 All the roads seem to be converging to the same value.

24
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:05,115
 Now there's still a little bit of variation look in this third column.

25
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,115
 Let's see what happens for P to the 20.

26
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,678
 While looking at the first column of P to the 20,

27
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:12,830
 we noticed that it seems to be converging quite nicely.

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,380
 They all agree on the first four significant digits.

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,610
 If we look at the other columns,

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,595
 we see that those are converging quite nicely as well.

31
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,133
 So what's our conclusion?

32
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,780
 Our conclusion is that there seems to be a row vector

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,080
 and all of the rows are converging to this row vector.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,480
 Now let's look at this matrix see what it means.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,935
 Take any particular column.

36
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:35,285
 Let's take column two. Now let's look at this entry one,

37
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,495
 two in this matrix P to the 20. What does that mean?

38
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:42,550
 Well it means if I start in stage one at time zero,

39
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,940
 what's the probability that I'm in stage two at time 20?

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,380
 Well that's exactly this entry.

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,765
 Similarly, if I start in stage two or three or four,

42
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:56,195
 what's the probability that I'm in stage two at time 20?

43
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,230
 Well regardless of where I start in,

44
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,835
 it seems like it's independent of where I start in.

45
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:04,570
 At time 20, it's going to be exactly this.

46
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,560
 And if I look at a larger time then this is going to converge even more.

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,625
 So there's going to be a specific probability that I'm in stage

48
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:16,265
 two for big time regardless of where I start at time zero.

49
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,210
 So that's the key property of this Markov chains.

50
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,255
 Regardless of where you start, it doesn't matter.

51
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:22,890
 If you look for big time,

52
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,140
 I'm going to converge to some value.

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,465
 So where I am at some big large time is independent of where I start.

54
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:30,465
 Let's say that again a little bit more precisely.
