1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 To illustrate the reduction it'll be useful to have

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,540
 a running example and we can fill in the numbers as we go along.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,625
 So let's consider this input formula to the 3SAT problem.

4
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,700
 It consists of three variables and four clauses.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,130
 For variable X1, there'll be two numbers,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,804
 the V1 and V1 prime,

7
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:19,830
 similarly for X2, there'll be V2 and V2 prime and for X3,

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,080
 there'll be V3 and V3 prime.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,525
 In addition there'll be two numbers for each clause,

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,930
 so we have S1 and S1 prime for clause one,

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,360
 S2 and S2 prime for clause two,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,460
 S3, S3 prime, S4,

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,800
 S4 prime for the last two clauses and finally we have t which is our desired sum.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,250
 These 15 numbers specify the input to the subset-sum problem.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,398
 These numbers are going to be seven digits long.

16
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:46,935
 The digits correspond to the variables,

17
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,230
 three variables and clauses, four clauses.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,640
 The first three digits correspond to the three variables, X1, X2,

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,860
 X3, the next four digits correspond to the four clauses.

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,950
 Now in assignment to f,

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,963
 either sets X1 to true or false,

22
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:08,490
 so we wanted that a subset-sum solution either includes V1 or V1 prime in the subset.

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,960
 How do we ensure that?

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,745
 We put a one in the first digit for V1,

25
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,505
 V1 prime and t. For all other numbers,

26
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:17,490
 we put a zero in the first digit.

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,010
 Now assuming there's no carry from the other digits,

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,470
 how can our subset of numbers achieve a sum of one in the first digit?

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,140
 Well, the only way is to include either V1 or V1 prime but not both and not neither.

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,700
 So we have to include exactly one of these two in

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,270
 order to achieve a sum of one in the first digit.

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,130
 Similarly we put a one in the second digit for V2 and V2 prime and for t,

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,120
 and in the third digit we put a one for V3,

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,585
 V3 prime and t. Then we put a zero for all other numbers in the second and third digits.

35
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:55,080
 This ensures that exactly one of V2 and V2 prime is in

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,925
 the subset and exactly one of V3

37
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:01,375
 and V3 prime is in the solution to the subset-sum problem.

38
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:06,180
 So now we know that any solution to the subset-sum problem corresponds to an assignment.

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,745
 Now we have to ensure that it corresponds to a satisfying assignment.

40
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:09,745
 So for that we use these remaining four digits.
