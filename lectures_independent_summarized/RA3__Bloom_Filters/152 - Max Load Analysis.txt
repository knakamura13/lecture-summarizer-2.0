Max load ≥ log n probability bounded, with at least one bin loaded ≥ log n necessary. Prob of a specific bin loaded ≥ log n ≤ 1/N². Summing over N bins, prob max load ≥ log n ≤ 1/N. Complementary event, max load < log n happens with prob ≥ 1-1/N. More detailed analysis suggests max load is Θ(log n / log log n). Prob can be improved to 1/N², 1/N¹⁰ by adjusting the constant, qualifying as high prob event (≥ 1-1/poly(N)), with adjustable poly(N) for tighter bounds.
