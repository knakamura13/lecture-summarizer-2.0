Transitioning from discussing a sink strongly connected component (SCC) to a source SCC, the key is to manage variable implications in a logical graph. With a source SCC, labeled S prime comprised of X4 and X2bar, setting this SCC to false will accordingly set X4 to false (unsatisfying it) and X2 to true. The source SCC lacks incoming edges, preventing any problematic backward implications. The false setting removes the component from consideration without worrying about outgoing implications. The counterpart literals, X4bar and X2, reside in a sink SCC, which has inbound but not outbound edges, ensuring all literals within it can be satisfied without further implications. Both processing source and sink SCCs—by setting the former to false and latter to true—achieve the same result, satisfying their literals without causing complications due to their strong connection and lack of problematic edges. These operations are complementary; sink and source SCCs contain inverted literals (if one is true, the other is false). Implementing this strategy allows the removal of SCCs in pairs (S prime and S prime bar), thus eliminating both the positive and negative literals of a variable from the graph. This step reduces the complexity of the logical formula and graph, permitting the repetition of the process. Consequently, the formula simplifies progressively, facilitating the resolution of the logical structure it represents.
