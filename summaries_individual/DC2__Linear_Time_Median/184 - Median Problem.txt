Divide and conquer strategy can efficiently solve the median finding prob. in an unsorted list A. For n even, median is defined as the smallest element at n/2 ceiling, for n odd, it's the (n/2)+1 smallest. The goal extends to finding the kth smallest, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Trivially, if A is sorted, select kth element from A. Normally, sorting A using algorithms like merge sort takes n log n time, hence a kth smallest element finding algo would also take n log n time if sorted array is a prerequisite. However, the Blum et al. algorithm from 1973 achieves this in linear n time without pre-sorting, showcasing a significant optimization. This was innovatively deduced in a single lunchtime session.
