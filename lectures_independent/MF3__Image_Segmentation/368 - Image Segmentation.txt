In this lecture, we'll look at an application of max flow to a problem from computer vision, known as Image Segmentation. We're given an image, such as this one, and our goal is to separate the image into objects. The easier tests that we're going to look at is to simply separate the image into foreground and background. For example, in this image we want to discern the triangle from the rest of the image.
