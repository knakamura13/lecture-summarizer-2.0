00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,925
 Let's start with the forward implication of this claim.

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:07,705
 So let's take a vertex cover S and let's prove that S bar is an independent set.

3
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:09,340
 So let's consider this example,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,285
 the red vertices are in vertex cover S. Now consider an edge of the graph.

5
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,565
 For instance, this is a particular edge,

6
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,535
 notice that at least one of the endpoints is red.

7
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:20,945
 Similarly for this edge,

8
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:22,545
 at least one of the endpoints is red.

9
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:26,850
 In this case both endpoints are red and in general we know for every edge X, Y,

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,290
 at least one of the endpoints is in the set S,

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,335
 because the vertex cover, covers every edge.

12
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:37,170
 And therefore, at most one of X or Y is in S bar,

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,215
 the complement of S. If at least one is in S then at most one is in S bar,

14
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:46,520
 this means that no edge of the graph is contained in S bar.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,725
 S bar contains at most one of the endpoints for every edge.

16
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:53,470
 So it doesn't contain both endpoints for any edge.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,350
 Therefore, S bar is an independent set.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,890
 So we've shown that if S is a vertex cover,

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:58,890
 then S bar is an independent set.
