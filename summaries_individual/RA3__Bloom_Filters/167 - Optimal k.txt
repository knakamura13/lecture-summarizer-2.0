Optimal choice of K hash functions minimizes false positive probability (FPP) in a hash table. FPP expressed as 1 - e^(-K/C)^K. Deriving optimal K yields K = C * ln(2). Upon substituting K back into FPP expression, result simplifies to .6185^C, where C is size of hash table relative to database size. This final expression allows calculation of FPP based on given hash table size. Additionally, optimal K ensures binary string H appears random, with bits set to zero or one with equal probability after M insertions. This balance in H's composition makes it resemble a randomly generated binary string.
