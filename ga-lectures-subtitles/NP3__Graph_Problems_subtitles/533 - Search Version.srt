00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,815
 My input is undirected graph as before and also a goal g.

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:11,205
 My output is an independent set S with size at least g. I want to output such a set S,

3
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:15,180
 if one exists, and if there is no independent set of such a size,

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,770
 then I simply output NO.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,770
 It will be straightforward to show that this version of the problem

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,505
 is a search problem and therefore lies in the class NP.

7
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:23,505
 And, in fact, will prove now that the independent set problem is NP-complete.
