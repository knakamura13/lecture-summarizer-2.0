Algorithm demonstrates a clever multiplication technique using binary representation. For illustrative purposes, consider X=182 and Y=154, in binary: 10110110 and 10011010, respectively. The approach divides X into XL (1011, or 11 in decimal) and XR (0110, or 6), and Y into YL (1001, or 9) and YR (1010, or 10). It computes XL*YL (11*9=99), XR*YR (6*10=60), and (XL+XR)*(YL+YR) = 17*19 = 323. The algorithm then follows a specific formula: Multiply XL*YL by 2^n (where n=8), subtract XL*YL and XR*YR from the (XL+XR)*(YL+YR) product, multiply the result by 2^(n/2), and add XR*YR to get the final product of X*Y, equaling 28,028. The process works with seemingly unrelated numbers, like 17 and 19 from our example, a non-intuitive aspect of the algorithm. Although further details on similar matrix multiplication (Strassen's algorithm) and the upcoming linear-time median algorithm are available, they're not covered here due to complexity. This multiplication method represents a fast way to multiply n-bit integers.
