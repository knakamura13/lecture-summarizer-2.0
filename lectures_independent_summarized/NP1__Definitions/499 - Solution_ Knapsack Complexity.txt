The knapsack problem's NP classification is unclear due to the challenge in verifying solutions efficiently. To confirm a solution's correctness, one must ensure the total weight doesn't exceed capacity (B), which is doable in order n time, and that the value sum is maximal. Unlike the MST problem, where optimality is checkable via algorithms like Kruskal's or Prim's, no such polynomial-time method exists for knapsack since the dynamic programming approach takes order n times B time, which is exponential relative to the input size. The inability to confirm solution optimality prevents us from definitively placing knapsack in the NP class. It's also not established that the knapsack problem is in the class P, as no polynomial-time algorithm is known. However, a variant of knapsack that includes a goal total value as an additional input parameter and drops the requirement for optimization does fit in NP, since checking if the value sum meets the goal is feasible, allowing for binary search on that parameter to find a solution.
