Algorithm performance varies with clause size K in max-Ek-SAT. For K=3, a clause's chance of being satisfied is 7/8,resulting in a 7/8 approx algorithm, optimal due to Hovstad's proof that surpassing 7/8 is NP-hard. Clause satisfaction probability for any K is 1 - 2^-K, leading to a (1 - 2^-K) approx algorithm for max-Ek-SAT, effective for large clauses. A new LP-based algo targets small clauses. The challenge arises when clause sizes vary; the simple algorithm excels only for uniform size-3 clauses.
