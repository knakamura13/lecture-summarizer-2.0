Edmonds-Karp algorithm's run time proven to be O(m^2n). Number of algorithm's augmenting path rounds <= m*n. Each round involves BFS, which is O(m) time given m >= n. Total run time O(m^2n) due to O(m) per round and O(mn) rounds. Focus: Prove max rounds = mn. Each round, residual graph's edge, min capacity on augmenting path, deleted. Edge can be re-added later. Key lemma: An edge e deleted and re-added to residual graph <= n/2 times. As m edges exist, each potentially deleted n/2 times, total rounds <= n/2 * m, confirming the algorithm's run time. Proof details follow to support lemma.
