The independent set problem is NP-complete, demonstrated through two steps. First, the problem is in NP because solutions can be verified in polynomial time. This is done by checking, in O(n^2) time, non-adjacency for vertex pairs in a proposed solution set S and confirming, in O(n) time, whether S meets the desired size g. Second, to establish NP-hardness, a polynomial-time reduction from a known NP-complete problem such as 3SAT to the independent set problem is shown. 3SAT is chosen for its simplicity, with clauses limited to three variables compared to SAT's potentially longer clauses. By accomplishing this reduction, the NP-completeness of the independent set problem is proven.
