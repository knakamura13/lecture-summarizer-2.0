Evaluating a linear programming (LP) scenario, changed objective function to maximize 2x-3y. Analyzed level sets within LP's feasible region using a heat map. Observed that the level set equation 2x-3y=c indicates increasing c values moving downwards. Optimal LP value identified at a specific feasible region vertex; thus, maximum is well-defined for this objective function. Noted that LP feasibility depends on constraints, whereas boundedness relates to the objective function.
