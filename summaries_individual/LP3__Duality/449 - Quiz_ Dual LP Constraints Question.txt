In the context of linear programming (LP), a primal LP with three variables leads to a dual LP with three constraints corresponding to these variables. The primal's two constraints give rise to two variables in the dual, named y1 and y2. The dual LP's goal is to minimize the objective function, represented by a linear combination of y1 and y2 with coefficients d1 and d2, creating vector d to be determined. Matrix e signifies the coefficients of y1 and y2 for each of the three dual constraints. The constraints are 'at least' typified by a vector f, which denotes the right-hand side values f1, f2, and f3 for each constraint, respectively. Additionally, the dual LP includes non-negativity constraints, requiring that y1 and y2 be non-negative. The next task involves specifying vector d, matrix e, and vector f to fully detail the dual LP.
