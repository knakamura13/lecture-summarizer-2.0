Multiplicative inverses are critical for the RSA algorithm and involve subtleties within modular arithmetic. In normal arithmetic, a number's multiplicative inverse is simply one divided by that number, which when multiplied together equals one. For example, 3's inverse is 1/3, and 3 * (1/3) = 1. In modular arithmetic, for a number z and modulus N, the goal is to find an inverse such that when multiplied by z results in 1 mod N. The multiplicative inverse of z mod N is denoted as z^-1 mod N and is a number x that satisfies the equation x*z â‰¡ 1 (mod N). This inverse relationship is reciprocal; if x is z's inverse mod N, then z is x's inverse mod N. Understanding and computing such inverses is essential for the functionality of the RSA encryption algorithm.
