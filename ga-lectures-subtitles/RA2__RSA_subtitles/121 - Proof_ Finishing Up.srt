1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
 So let's recap where we are.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,180
 Our goal is to show that Z raised to the power P

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,990
 minus one is congruent to 1 mod P. What have we done so far?

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,770
 We've looked at these two sets S,

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,615
 which are the possible values for Z.

6
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,630
 One, two, up to P minus one,

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,140
 and we have this set S Prime,

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,246
 which we obtained by taking the elements of S,

9
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:20,715
 multiplying each one by Z,

10
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:22,770
 and then taking at mod P. So,

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,600
 we have this set of elements,

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,520
 and we've shown, that S and S Prime are the same.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,420
 Just in possibly different order.

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,420
 Now, we're going to use that fact that S and as Prime are the same,

15
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,065
 in order to prove this theorem statement.

16
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,725
 So, what are we going to do.?

17
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:39,615
 We're going to multiply the elements of S together,

18
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:42,610
 and we're going to multiply the elements of S Prime together.

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,565
 The elements are the same, just in possibly different order.

20
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:47,790
 So, when we multiply the elements of S together,

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,020
 we should get the same product,

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,985
 as when we multiply the elements of S Prime together.

23
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,140
 So, when we multiply the elements of S together, what do we get?

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,995
 We get 1 times 2 times 3 up to P minus 1.

25
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,980
 When we multiply the elements of S Prime together, what do we get?

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,620
 We get one time Z, then we get two times Z,

27
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,070
 then we get three times Z, and so on,

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,645
 the last term is P minus one times Z.

29
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,360
 And these are the same,

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,820
 modulo P. So, on the left hand side,

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,245
 we've got the elements of S multiply together.

32
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,885
 On the right hand side, we've got the elements of S Prime multiplied together.

33
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:21,960
 So, we've got the same numbers,

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,088
 just in different order, and we're taking it mod P,

35
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:26,880
 because these sets are the same with

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,335
 respect to mod P. What do we got on the left hand side?

37
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:30,915
 Let's just simplify it a little bit.

38
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,030
 This is P minus 1 factorial right?

39
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,682
 What do we got in the right hand side?

40
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,325
 Well, we got Z, Z, Z.

41
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:37,530
 How many Z's do we got?

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,960
 We got P minus one Z's. Now that looks good.

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,290
 Now we're starting to look like the theorem statement. And what else do we got?

44
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,240
 We got one times two times three,

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,870
 up to P minus one.

46
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,975
 So, we got another P minus one factorial.

47
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,580
 And these are the same mod P. Okay?

48
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,307
 Can we get rid of this P minus one factorial?

49
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,405
 In normal real arithmetic,

50
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:58,180
 we can just cancel it out.

51
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,400
 We cancel out here. Well, does the inverse exist?

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
 Notice P is prime.

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,430
 So, that means that there is an inverse for one,

54
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,870
 two, up to P minus one.

55
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,800
 Each of these numbers has an inverse mod P. Each

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,870
 of these P minus one numbers has an inverse mod P,

57
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,415
 because P is a prime.

58
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:20,685
 So, they're all relatively prime to P. So,

59
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,495
 we can multiply both sides by these inverses. And what happens?

60
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,347
 We get rid of this one times two times three,

61
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,220
 up to P minus one from both sides.

62
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,970
 So that cancels out the P minus 1 factorial.

63
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,365
 And then, what are we left with?

64
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,910
 We're left with, one is congruent to Z to the P minus one

65
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:36,910
 mod P. Which is the theorem statement we're trying to prove. So we're done.
