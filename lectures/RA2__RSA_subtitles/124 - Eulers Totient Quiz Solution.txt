Now, let's go ahead and look at what phi_of_n is for this case when n_equals_p_times_q. Let's write out all the numbers that we're looking at. We're looking at the numbers between one and p_times_q. So, this pq numbers here. How many of these numbers are multiples of p? Well, p, two_times_p, up to q_times_p, are all multiples of p. How many of those are there? There's q of them. So, q are multiples of p. How many are multiples of q? There's q, two_times_q, up to p_times_q. So, p of these numbers are multiples of q. So, each of these numbers has a common divisor with p_times_q, namely p. And each of these numbers has a common divisor with p_times_q, namely q. So, we have to exclude all these numbers. So we had p_times_q numbers originally. Q of them are multiples of p, and p of them are multiples of q. And look, we double counted. P times q is counted twice, so let's add one while I can. This can be rewritten as p_minus_one_times_q_minus_one. So, what is phi_of_n for the case when n is p_times_q for prime numbers p and q? Is p_minus_one_times_q.
