Analyzing max load on Bin Bi, discovered that load probability exceeds LogN is low. Calculating exact load of LogN for Bin Bi involves choosing specific LogN balls from N (N choose LogN ways). Probability of these LogN balls being in Bin Bi is (1/N)^LogN. Probability for other balls irrelevant to calculating load > LogN, hence upper bound includes all other balls in any bin, yielding an overestimate. To bound N choose LogN, approximated by (N/K)^K, using Stirling’s formula for an upper bound of (N*e/K)^K. Substituting K=LogN gives an upper bound for the probability of Bin Bi having load ≥ LogN as (E/LogN)^(LogN). As N increases, this upper bound decreases; setting it to (1/4)^(LogN) for large N, specifically when N > 2^11 (as LogN > 4E). Assuming a log base of two, this equates to a max probability of load ≥ LogN of 1/N^2, which is small for large N, indicating a low likelihood of any bin Bi receiving a load ≥ LogN.
