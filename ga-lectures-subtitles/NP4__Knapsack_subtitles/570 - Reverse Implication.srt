1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
 Let's prove the reverse implication that a satisfying assignment for

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,920
 the 3SAT formula corresponds to a solution to the subset-sum instance.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,260
 So let's take a satisfying assignment for f,

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,395
 and we'll construct a solution to the subset-sum instance in the following manner.

5
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:16,080
 In our satisfying assignment,

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,450
 if we set the variable X to the ith to true,

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,745
 then we add the number V to the ith to the solution S.

8
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:25,665
 And if we set the variable X to the ith to false in our satisfying assignment,

9
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:29,970
 then we add the number of V to the ith prime to our solution S. We're

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,650
 adding exactly one of V to the ith and V to the ith prime to S. This means,

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,050
 in the ith digit, we get exactly one.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,040
 So the ith digit of T is correct.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,403
 Now let's look at the jth clause.

14
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:45,180
 We started from a satisfying assignment, therefore,

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,420
 at least one of the literals in this clause is satisfied.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,325
 The numbers corresponding to these literals give us a sum of one, two,

17
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:59,370
 or three in the digit n plus j. T has three in digit n plus j.

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,870
 So how do we achieve a sum of three digit n plus j?

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,580
 Well, using the numbers corresponding to these literals,

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,910
 we get a sum of one, two, or three,

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,705
 and then we can use S to the jth and/or S to the jth prime to get up to a sum of three.

22
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:17,580
 This ensures that digit n plus j is correct and therefore,

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,110
 the last m digits are correct and the first digits are correct.

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,620
 And therefore, we have a solution to the subset-sum instance.

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:25,620
 So we've proved this equivalence and we've proved that our reduction is correct.
