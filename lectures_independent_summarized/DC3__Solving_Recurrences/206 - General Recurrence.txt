Analyzing recurrences with constants a & b > 1, the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + O(n) expands into a geometric series. The series' behavior depends on the a/b ratio. If a > b, the series increases and the last term defines the growth, resulting in O(n^logb(a)). For a = b, the series' terms are constant, creating O(n log n) growth, like with merge sort. If a < b, the series decreases and the first term prevails, simplifying the growth to O(n). Extensions of this concept, for recurrences of the form O(n^d), follow the master theorem, which offers a more detailed solution framework.
