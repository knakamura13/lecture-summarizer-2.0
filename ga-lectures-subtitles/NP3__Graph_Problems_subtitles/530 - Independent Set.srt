00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,915
 First off, what is an independent set?

2
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:05,200
 Well, let's consider an undirected graph G,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,790
 here's an undirected graph.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,725
 A subset of vertices is an independent set

5
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,955
 if there are no edges contained in that subset of vertices.

6
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:14,575
 The green vertices here,

7
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:18,730
 the three vertices, are an example of an independent set for this graph.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,360
 To check that this subset is an independent set,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,320
 we can check all pairs of vertices in this subset,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,030
 and we can check that these pairs are not adjacent.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,875
 Here is another example of an independent set,

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,730
 this one of size six.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,750
 Now, it's trivial to find very small independent sets.

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,095
 For example, the empty set is an independent set,

15
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,055
 or any singleton vertex is an independent set.

16
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:40,055
 The challenging problem is to find the large independent set.
