P class represents problems solvable in polynomial time. NP stands for non-deterministic polynomial time; NP problems are solvable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic machine, which can "guess" a path to an accepting state. A key misconception clarified: NP does not mean "not polynomial time." Whether P equals NP remains an open question. Non-deterministic machines can follow various paths to reach acceptance without a specific rule, unlike deterministic machines with set transitions. Understanding of non-determinism is limited but vital in distinguishing P from NP.
