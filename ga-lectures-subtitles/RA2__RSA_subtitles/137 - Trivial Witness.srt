1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,285
 Once again, we have a number R and we're trying to determine if R is prime or composite.

2
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:09,525
 Now we say number Z is a Fermat witness for R. First off,

3
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,355
 Z lies between one and R minus.

4
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:16,140
 And crucially Z raised to the power R minus one is

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,190
 not congruent to one mod R. Then by Fermat's little theorem,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,350
 we know that R is composite.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,110
 Because if R is prime every such Z,

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,280
 Z raised to the power R minus one,

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,420
 is congruent to one mod R. So if we get a Z where is not

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,930
 true then this R must be composite.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,930
 So Z is a witness to the fact via Fermat's little theorem that R is composite.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,645
 We want to first prove that every composite number has at least one Fermat witness.

13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,095
 So let's prove this fact.

14
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:49,910
 Now, R is composite so we know it has at least two divisors.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,670
 So take a Z which is a divisor of R. So clearly this Z,

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,845
 which is a divisor of R, lies between one and R minus one.

17
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,370
 What else do we know about this Z?

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,060
 Well, look at its GCD.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,670
 What do we know about the GCD of R and Z?

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,030
 Well, if we take Z to be a divisor of R

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,150
 then we know the greatest common divisor of these two numbers is Z itself.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,010
 And since R is composite,

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,380
 we know this divisor is greater than one.

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,825
 Well, actually, this proof works for any Z where this statement is true.

25
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:21,165
 So any Z which is not relatively prime to R. And if R is composite,

26
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:25,710
 we always know there is at least two such Z's which are not relatively prime to R. Now,

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,560
 if the GCD of R and Z is greater than one,

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
 what do we know?

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,690
 Well, if you recall from our previous lecture about modular arithmetic,

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,260
 what about the inverse of Z mod R?

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,395
 We know it does not exist.

32
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:41,330
 There is no inverse of Z mod R. Why?

33
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,100
 Because the inverse of Z mod R exist,

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,385
 if and only if the GCD of R and Z is one.

35
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,200
 They're relatively prime to each other.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,290
 Now, we want a proof for this Z that Z raised to the power R

37
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,670
 minus one is not congruent to one mod R. What are we going to do?

38
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,970
 Let's suppose that it is congruent to one mod R. So suppose that Z raised

39
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,980
 to the power R minus one is congruent to

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,090
 one mod R. That's the opposite of what we're trying to prove.

41
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,270
 So what will show is that,

42
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,170
 if this holds then we get a contradiction.

43
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,630
 How will we get a contradiction?

44
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,600
 Will show that Z has

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,210
 an inverse mod R. And we know that's not the case therefore we have a contradiction,

46
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,215
 therefore this assumption cannot hold,

47
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:24,945
 and therefore Z raised to the power R minus one must not be congruent to one mod R. Okay?

48
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:29,785
 Now, we have the fact that Z raised to the power R minus one is congruent one mod R. Now,

49
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:33,255
 Z raised to the power R minus one is the same as the following.

50
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:37,590
 It's the same as Z raised to the power R minus two times Z.

51
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,605
 This product is Z raised to the power R minus one.

52
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:43,675
 So if Z raised to the power R minus one is congruent to one mod R,

53
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:46,775
 then Z raised to the R minus two times Z

54
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:50,580
 is also congruent to one mod R. Now, look at this statement.

55
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,270
 Z times Z to the R minus two is congruent to

56
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,670
 one mod R. That means that Z has an inverse. What's its inverse?

57
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,220
 It's this number Z to the are minus two.

58
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,420
 Because when we look at the product of these two,

59
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,615
 it's one mod R. That's the definition of the inverse.

60
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:11,945
 So Z to the R minus two is the inverse of Z and Z is the inverse of Z to the R minus two.

61
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:15,000
 But we know that Z does not have an inverse mod R,

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,830
 therefore we have a contradiction.

63
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,220
 And thus, this assumption cannot hold and therefore we know that Z to the R minus one is

64
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,890
 not congruent to one mod R. And that

65
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:25,890
 proves that every composite R has at least one Fermat witness.
