The Max-flow-min-cut theorem asserts the equivalence between the maximum possible flow from source vertex s to sink vertex t in a flow network and the smallest capacity among all s-t cuts in the network. Although the minimum capacity cut issue doesn't inherently require distinguishing between source s and sink t, in the context of the theorem, distinction becomes necessary, hence the min st-cut terminology. To prove the theorem, one must establish that the max-flow's size cannot exceed that of any given st-cut and conversely as well. The initial part of the proof demonstrates that any flow's magnitude within the network is necessarily limited by the capacity of an arbitrary st-cut. This concept is extended to argue that it's also true when the flow is maximized and the st-cut has the minimum capacity, thereby proving one direction of the theorem. The proof's complexity is thus reduced to showing this relationship for any chosen flow and st-cut without the need to confirm their optimality within the network.
