Need to manipulate polynomial with exponents that are logarithmic expressions. Transformation of 3^(log base 2 of n) into a polynomial n^c. Key step involves changing the exponential base to match the logarithmic base, in this case from 3 to 2, by expressing 3 as 2^(log base 2 of 3). By substitution and using logarithmic properties, the exponent becomes a product: log base 2 of 3 * log base 2 of n, which allows for swapping exponents and simplifying. This leads to identifying the polynomial's exponent c as log base 2 of 3, proving that 3^(log base 2 of n) equals n^(log base 2 of 3).
