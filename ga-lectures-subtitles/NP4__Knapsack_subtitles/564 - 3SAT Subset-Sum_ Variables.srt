1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,625
 Now let's take a look at the actual specification of the input to the subset sum problem.

2
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:08,025
 Let's start with these numbers corresponding to the two n literals,

3
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:11,945
 in particular Vi corresponds to Xi.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,405
 So we're going to include this number Vi in the subset S,

5
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:18,840
 if and only if the literal Xi is set to true.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,370
 Similarly Vi prime corresponds to Xi bar and will include

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,460
 Vi prime in this subset S if and only if the variable Xi is set to false.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,335
 And assignment for the three set formula either sets Xi to true or Xi to false.

9
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,980
 Therefore, we need for the subset sum problem that either we include

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,854
 Vi in S or Vi prime in S. Well,

11
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:44,293
 we can't include both and we can include neither,

12
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,545
 because then we don't know how to set Xi.

13
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:52,615
 So we need to ensure that exactly one of Vi or Vi prime is in S. How do we achieve this?

14
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:55,635
 Well, in the Ith digit of these three numbers Vi,

15
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,125
 Vi prime and T we put a one.

16
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,750
 In all other numbers,

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,685
 we put a zero in the Ith digit.

18
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:03,141
 Now by using base 10,

19
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,610
 we will ensure that there is no carrys between the digits.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,585
 So each digit is going to behave independently of each other.

21
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,470
 Recall that T is our desire sum,

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,195
 so the only way to achieve a desired sum that has a one in the Ith digit,

23
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:19,005
 is to include either Vi or Vi prime in S,

24
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,240
 but not both and not neither.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
 So this specification ensures that

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,435
 our solution to the subset sum problem is going to correspond to an assignment.

27
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:29,948
 Whether it's satisfying or not is another issue,

28
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:32,825
 but for now at least we know that we have an assignment.

29
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:32,825
 So either we're going to correspond to Xi being set to true or Xi being set.
