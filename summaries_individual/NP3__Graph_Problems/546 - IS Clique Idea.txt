Independent sets and cliques in graphs are fundamentally opposite conceptsâ€”an independent set lacks edges between its vertices, while a clique is a subset with edges connecting all pairs of vertices. To utilize a clique-solving algorithm for independent set problems, one can invert a given graph G to its complement G bar, which retains the same vertices but includes an edge between vertex pair X,Y only if such an edge is absent in G. Consequently, a set S is an independent set in G if and only if S is a clique in G bar. This relationship is intuitive and requires no formal proof; the absence of edges among vertices in S in graph G ensures that in G bar, all vertices in S are interlinked, qualifying S as a clique. Conversely, if S is a clique in G bar, it must be an independent set in the original graph G.
