And we're going to start by looking at a very simple randomized algorithm, and we'll show that this simple algorithm achieves a one-half approximation algorithm for Max-SAT. After that, we're going to look at an LP-based algorithm and we're going to prove that this new LP-based algorithm achieves a 1-1_over_E approximation factor, so to improve the previous algorithm by a little bit. Finally, we're going to look at an algorithm which is a combination of these two algorithms, and this combined algorithm is going to achieve a three-quarters approximation. So let's dive into the simple scheme.
