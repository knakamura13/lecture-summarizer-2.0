1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,895
 Now, let's go ahead and write a recurrence for C(i,j).

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:06,270
 In our graphical view, this corresponds to the root of

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,985
 the tree which corresponds to Ai through Aj.

4
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:13,305
 We're going to try all possibilities for the split

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,230
 at index L and we're going to take the best of those.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,171
 The best means minimum costs,

7
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:20,700
 so we're going to do a minimization over the choices of

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,360
 L and L is allowed to vary between i and j minus one.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,433
 And we have this left subtree and this right subtree.

10
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:32,130
 The left subtree corresponds to Ai through Al.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,915
 The right subtree corresponds to Ai plus one through Aj.

12
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:41,224
 The minimum cost for computing this left subtree is the entry C(i,l).

13
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:45,205
 The minimum costs for computing this right subtree is Cl plus 1j.

14
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,225
 Finally, we have to combine these together.

15
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,835
 Recall this product matrix is of size Mi minus one

16
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:55,215
 by Ml and this product matrix is of size Ml by Mj.

17
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,790
 To multiply these together,

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,270
 the cost is Mi minus one times Ml times Mj.

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,795
 Adding that term into our recurrence.

20
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:08,210
 We take the mean over the choices of L where L can vary from i to j minus one.

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,780
 And for that specific L,

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,310
 the cost is the cost for the left subtree

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,620
 C(i,l) plus the costs for the optimal right subtrees CL plus

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,010
 one j plus the cost of merging that left subtree with

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,890
 that right subtree which is Mi minus one times Ml times Mj.

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,980
 We take the sum of those three terms and we take

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:28,980
 the L which minimizes that sum some That's our recurrence for C(i,j).
