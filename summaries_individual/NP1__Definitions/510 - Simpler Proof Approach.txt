The SAT (satisfiability) problem is NP-complete, meaning it's in NP and all NP problems can be reduced to it. Proving another problem, like the independent sets problem, as NP-complete requires two steps: showing it's in NP, and demonstrating a reduction from a known NP-complete problem, SAT in this case, to it. Composing reductions ensures that if SAT reduces to the independent sets problem, then all NP problems can reduce to it, proving the latter's NP-completeness. Errors often occur when students attempt reductions in the reverse direction, which doesn't establish NP-completeness. To prove the independent sets problem's NP-completeness, verify solutions in polynomial time, and then reduce the SAT problem to it. This process confirms that the new problem has comparable computational difficulty to other NP-complete problems.
