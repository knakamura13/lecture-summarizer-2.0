Now, let's formulate this problem as a linear program. Now, we're going to have three variables X1, X2, X3, corresponding to how much we produce of A, and B, and C, respectively, per day. Now, our goal is to maximize the profit. So, our objective function is going to mean maximize X1 plus 6 X2 plus 10X3 based on our profit assumption. Now, we have two demand constraints. X1 is at most 300 and X2 is at most 200. Now, we have one supply constraint, X1 plus 3X2 plus 2X3 is at most 1000. And finally, the packaging constraint says that X2 plus 3X3 is at most 500. And let's not forget the non-negativity constraints. X1, X2, X3 all have to be non-negative.
