Assessing the viability of the SAT problem multiple times, we understand it's NP-complete, making a polynomial time solution implausible. SAT is a search problem involving a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form, where we seek true/false variable assignments to make the formula true, or return no if there's no solution. Transitioning to the Max-SAT problem, which is an optimization version where the goal differsâ€”despite the possibility of unsatisfiability, we seek an assignment that maximizes the number of satisfiable clauses. This introduces further complexity, with Max-SAT classified as NP-hard since there's no efficient verification method to confirm a maximal solution. Recognizing Max-SAT's complexity at least matches SAT's, we acknowledge that approximations via linear programming are our best recourse, as polynomial time solutions remain out of reach.
