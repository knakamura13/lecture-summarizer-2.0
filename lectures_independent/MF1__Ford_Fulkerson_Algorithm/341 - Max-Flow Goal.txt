Now our goal in the max flow problem is to find a valid flow. So one satisfying the capacity constraints and the conservation of flow constrains, and we want to find a valid flow of maximum size. What exactly do we mean by maximum size? What is the size of a flow? Well, the size of the flow is the total flow sent. This can be measured by the total flow out of s or the flow into t.
