1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
 Now, there's one additional edge that I almost forgot to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,995
 mention in this graph G prime that we're constructing.

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:10,020
 Now, notice in the original graph S is the start vertex and T is the end vertex.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,315
 In this new graph,

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,650
 S and T are internal vertices.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,500
 So, the flow in has to equal the flow-out for both these vertices.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,130
 Whereas over here, we don't have that constraint.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,690
 Notice there's no flow-in.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,565
 There's no capacity into this vertex,

10
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,635
 S and T has no capacity.

11
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:31,320
 So, in the current set up we don't have any flow into S and any flow out of

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,870
 T. How do we get around that so that we can have the

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,785
 flow-in S equal to the flow-out and similarly for T?

14
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:42,070
 Well, we know the flow-out of S equals the flow into T,

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,040
 so we simply have to offset the flow-out of T and the flow-in to S. So,

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,030
 we compare these up with each other.

17
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,440
 So, we're going to add this edge from T to

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,845
 S. And we don't have any constraints on the flow along this edge,

19
00:00:55,845 --> 00:01:01,050
 our flow goes into T. We want to send that back to S. So,

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,495
 we give this edge capacity infinity.

21
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:09,060
 So, to summarize, we're adding this edge from T to S and the capacity is infinite.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,060
 Now, we really have completed our construction of this graph G prime.
