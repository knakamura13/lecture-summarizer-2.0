1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
 Now let's look at the reverse implication.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,239
 In this case we're going to take a satisfying assignment for C to

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,540
 the second prime and we're going to

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,970
 construct a satisfying assignment for C to the second.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,165
 What we're going to show is that if we just ignore y,

6
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:14,295
 whatever the assignment was for x to the first,

7
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,420
 x to the second, x to the third,

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,210
 and x to the fourth which satisfied C to the second prime,

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,480
 that's going to satisfy C to the second.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,195
 Now there will be two cases,

11
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,985
 either y is true or y is false.

12
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:26,725
 Suppose y is true.

13
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,304
 We know that C to the second prime is satisfied,

14
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:32,000
 so each of these two clauses is satisfied.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,719
 y is true so that satisfies this clause.

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,775
 How about the second clause?

17
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,940
 Well, either x to the first must be false or x to the fourth must be false.

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,656
 Well, if x to the first is false or x to the fourth is false,

19
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:48,540
 both of these satisfy C to the second.

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,990
 So in either of these scenarios,

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,325
 we have an assignment which satisfies C to the second.

22
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:55,285
 Now suppose y is false.

23
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:59,030
 So this assignment for y satisfies this second clause.

24
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,970
 How do we satisfy this first clause?

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,641
 What we're assuming that this is a satisfying assignment for C to

26
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:07,800
 the second prime so it must satisfy this first clause.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,530
 y is false, so that's not helping.

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,415
 So it must be the case that either x to the second is false or x to the third is true.

29
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:18,360
 So either x to the second is false or x to the third is true.

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,085
 Now if x to the second is false,

31
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:22,482
 that means that this is an assignment which satisfies C

32
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,900
 to the second and if x to the third is true,

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,410
 then also this is an assignment which satisfies C to the second.

34
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,150
 So in any of these four cases,

35
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,745
 we have an assignment which satisfies C to the second.

36
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:36,680
 So every satisfying assignment for C to the second prime if we ignore y,

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,235
 it's also a satisfying assignment for C to the second.

38
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:41,550
 And this establishes the reverse implication.

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,815
 We've done both directions,

40
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:42,815
 so we've shown the if and only if.
