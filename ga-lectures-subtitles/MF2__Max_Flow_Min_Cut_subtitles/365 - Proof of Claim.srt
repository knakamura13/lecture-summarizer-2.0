1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
 So let's go ahead and prove the claim.

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:04,500
 So let's take a flow f* that has

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,645
 no augmenting path in this residual network and we wanted to find an s-t cut now.

4
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:12,495
 We want to use this property about this f*.

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:16,240
 We know there's no st-path in this residual network.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,660
 So we know that t is not reachable from this vertex s in this graph.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,960
 So that's a way to separate s from t. Therefore,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,900
 we're going to let L be those vertices which are

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,615
 reachable from the vertex s in this residual network.

10
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,085
 Now we know this vertex t is not in this set L, why?

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:39,620
 Because we know there's no path from s to t in this residual network,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,380
 that's our assumption about this flow f*.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,170
 Therefore, we let R be the remaining vertices and we

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,400
 know that the vertex t is in this set R. So s is clearly reachable from itself.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,515
 So s is in L and t is in R. So this set (L,

16
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,900
 R) is an s-t cut.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,219
 So we've constructed our s-t cut,

18
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,820
 now we have to prove that this s-t cut has

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:02,820
 capacity which is equal to the size of this flow.
