1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,490
 This was our construction,

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,557
 we took this clause of size k. So we took C which was a₁ or

3
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:10,931
 a₂ up to aₖ and we defined this formula C prime,

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:14,122
 which consisted of K-2 clauses.

5
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:20,090
 And our claim is that C is satisfiable if and only if C prime is satisfiable.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,205
 Now, let's prove this claim.

7
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:23,195
 Let's start with the forward implication.

8
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:26,765
 So, let's take an assignment to these literals which satisfies this clause

9
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:31,680
 C and let's prove that there is a satisfying assignment to C prime.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,425
 Now, in order for this assignment to satisfy C,

11
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,215
 one of these literals must be satisfied.

12
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:41,505
 Let's let ai be the first satisfied literal.

13
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:44,818
 So, let ai be the first literal satisfied.

14
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:49,715
 Now, if ai is satisfied that's going to satisfy one of these clauses.

15
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,660
 i = 1 so,

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,205
 a1 that's in the first clause and if i is at least two,

17
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:59,690
 then ai appears in the i minus first clause.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,795
 So, this literal ai being set to true satisfies the i minus first clause of C prime.

19
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,635
 Let's suppose i was four.

20
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:13,890
 So, we have a four equals to true and this clause is satisfied, so we can remove them.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,030
 Now, what about the i minus two earlier clauses?

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,470
 Well, we can use these positive forms of

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,520
 these auxiliary variables to satisfy these earlier clauses.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,830
 So, we set y one in y two to be true in this case and in general we set y one through

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:35,085
 yi - 2 to true and this satisfies the first i minus two clauses of C prime.

26
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:39,360
 So, this setting of the first i - 2 auxiliary variables

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,865
 satisfies the first i - 2 clauses,

28
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:45,810
 ai set to true satisfies the i - 2 first clause.

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,740
 What do we do about the later clauses?

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,840
 Well, here we're going to use the negative form of these auxiliary variables.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,495
 We set the remaining auxiliary variables to false.

32
00:01:55,495 --> 00:02:02,980
 In this case yk minus four bar and yk minus three bar and in general we set yi

33
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,430
 - 1 through yk - 2 to false and this

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,720
 satisfies the remaining clauses which appear after the i minus first clause.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,955
 The punchline is that this literal satisfies the i minus first clause of C prime.

36
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:18,310
 We use these auxiliary variables to satisfy

37
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,640
 the earlier clauses and we use these auxiliary variables to satisfy the later clauses.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,860
 So, we only need one literal of C to be satisfied,

39
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,115
 and then we can use the auxiliary variables to satisfy all the other clauses of C prime.

40
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:34,115
 Now, let's do the reverse implication.
