1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 Once again, FFT when we run it with input little a.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,180
 Which are the coefficients for this polynomial a of X and the nth root of unity,

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,000
 then it outputs capital A,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,450
 which is a value of this polynomial at the nth root of unity,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,350
 which corresponds to the product of this matrix M times little a.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,920
 Now for inverse FFT,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,515
 we want to take these values of this polynomial and multiply by the inverse of them.

8
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:31,905
 And that will give us little a the coefficients.

9
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,530
 What does the inverse of M look like?

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,057
 Well what we show is that the inverse of M equals one over n,

11
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,945
 just a scaling factor,

12
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:50,585
 times Mn with instead of Mn with omegas of n It's omegas of n to the inverse.

13
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,035
 So we take the same matrix Mn,

14
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:56,295
 and instead of plugging in the nth root of unity,

15
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:59,370
 we plug in the inverse of the nth root of unity.

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,165
 Now what exactly is the inverse of the nth root of unity?

17
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:08,235
 Well, this is the number when multiplied by omegas of n equals one.

18
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,400
 You multiply a number by its inverse you get one.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900
 So what is the inverse?

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,405
 It's omegas of n to the n minus one.

21
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:18,470
 It's the last of the nth roots of unity.

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,155
 Notice that if you multiply omegas of n times

23
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:24,225
 omega of n to the nth minus one, what do you get?

24
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:26,160
 You get omegas of n, to the nth.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,635
 Which is the same as omegas of n to the zeroth power, which is one.

26
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:36,315
 So the inverse of omegas of n is omegas of n to the nth minus one.

27
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:41,125
 So the inverse of omegas of n is omegas of n to the n minus one.

28
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,370
 Now this is the basic facts,

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,480
 so we should make sure that is clear for you.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,200
 If it's not intuitively clear,

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,650
 I would either convince yourself by plugging in these points

32
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,270
 in polar coordinates and also you can look at it geometrically.

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,160
 So draw the picture of the complex plane and look at these points on the unit circle.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,795
 Now we can plug this in and simplify.

35
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,450
 So the inverse of this matrix M,

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,675
 with parameter omegas of n,

37
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:10,605
 is one over n times this matrix with

38
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:10,605
 the inverse of omegas of n which is omega of n to the n minus one.
