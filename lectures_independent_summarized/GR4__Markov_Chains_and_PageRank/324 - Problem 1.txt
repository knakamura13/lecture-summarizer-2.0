Initial page ranking idea involved the in-degree of a webpage, basically counting the incoming links to set rank. Discovered imbalances in valuing each link equally, highlighted by an example where a link from a Georgia Tech faculty list (with ~1000 links) to one's personal page and a link from a high-profile page with just 5 links to another's page were both valued equally. Resolved this by scaling the rank with the number of outgoing links from the referring page, assigning partial credit based on this. Therefore, a page linking out 1000 times would contribute 1/1000 of a point to the linked page's rank, while a page with only 5 outgoing links would contribute 1/5 of a point per link.
