Examining a two-dimensional variable space, with the first constraint limiting x1 to a maximum of 300 and the second capping x2 at 200, restricts feasible points to the lower-left quadrant bounded by these lines. Adding non-negativity constraints forms a rectangle; within this, the final (fifth) constraint further narrows the possible area to a tan-colored convex polygon, identified as the feasible region where all five constraints are met.
