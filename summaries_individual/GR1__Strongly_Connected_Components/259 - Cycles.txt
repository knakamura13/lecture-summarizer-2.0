Graph G has a cycle if and only if its DFS tree has a back edge, regardless of start vertex or adjacency list order. This holds both ways: if G has a cycle, a first vertex (i) will be explored, and all cycle vertices are in the subtree of i. One of these vertices, i - 1, has an edge to i, creating a back edge to an ancestor, indicating a cycle. Conversely, if there's a back edge from a descendant (a) to an ancestor (b) in the DFS tree, a cycle is formed by following tree edges back from b to a, then taking the back edge from a to b. Therefore, a back edge presence signifies a cycle in G.
