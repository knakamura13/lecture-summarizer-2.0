Input from a 3-SAT problem with a formula F containing N variables (X1-Xn) and M clauses (C1-CM), where each clause has up to 3 literals, is translated into an Independent Set problem by constructing a graph G. Set a target 'g' equal to M (the number of clauses) for the Independent Set problem. Construct graph G by making a vertex for each literal in a clause, leading to at most 3M vertices since there are M clauses. Edges are added within clauses to encode the literal relationships and between clauses to ensure consistent variable assignments across the graph.
