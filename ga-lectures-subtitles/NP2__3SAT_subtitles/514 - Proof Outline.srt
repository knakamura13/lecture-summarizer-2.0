1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,855
 We're going to show now that 3SAT problem is NP complete.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:05,580
 Before we dive into the proof,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,380
 let's outline what we need to show in order to

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,275
 establish that the 3SAT problem is NP complete.

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:14,670
 The first thing we need to show is that the 3SAT problem lies in the class NP.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,965
 This will be straightforward to prove.

7
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:20,730
 Now our main task is to take a known NP complete problem.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,790
 In this case, all we know is that SAT is NP complete.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,415
 So we have to just show a reduction from SAT problem,

10
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,285
 to the 3SAT problem.

11
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,701
 Now once we've shown this reduction from SAT to 3SAT,

12
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,036
 what does that establish?

13
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,995
 That establishes that for every problem in NP,

14
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,435
 we have a reduction from this problem A to SAT.

15
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:41,110
 And then we have this reduction from SAT to 3SAT,

16
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,445
 therefore, we have a reduction from A to 3SAT.

17
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,750
 The implication of this is,

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,780
 that if we have a polynomial time algorithm for 3SAT,

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,570
 then we have a polynomial time algorithm for every problem in NP,

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,600
 because we can reduce every problem in NP to 3SAT.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,860
 So let's start with the easy task.

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:57,860
 Let's prove that 3SAT is in the class N-
