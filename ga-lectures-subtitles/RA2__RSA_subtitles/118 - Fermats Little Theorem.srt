00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
 Before we dive into the RSA cryptosystem,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,010
 we're going to dive into the mathematical concept

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,585
 which is the basis for the whole cryptosystem.

4
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:10,305
 The key concept is Fermat's little theorem.

5
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:11,925
 Take a prime number P,

6
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,610
 then for every number Z, which is at most,

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,775
 P minus one and least one.

8
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:20,110
 If we look at Z raised to the power P minus one mod p,

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,930
 what is that going to equal?

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,670
 That's going to be congruent to one.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,930
 So for any Z, which is relatively prime to P,

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,425
 so this statement here,

13
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,610
 can be replaced by any Z,

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,995
 which is relatively prime to P. So the gcd of Z and P is one.

15
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,573
 For any such Z, if P is prime, if we take Z,

16
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:42,300
 raiseed to the power P minus one is going to be congruent to one mod p. This

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,700
 easy to state fact is going to be the basis of the RSA cryptosystem.

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,850
 It's also going to be the basis of a primality testing algorithm.

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,415
 So, if we're given a number x,

20
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,820
 and we want to test whether x is prime or not,

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,040
 we're going to devise an algorithm based on Fermat's little theorem.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,660
 Now, we're going to look at the proof of Fermat's little theorem.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,960
 It's not too hard, it's not too easy,

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,695
 it's reasonable proof, but it's a very beautiful proof, very elegant.

25
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:07,740
 And there are several important ideas in the proof.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,830
 For example, how does it come up that P is prime?

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,170
 How does that come into the proof?

28
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,935
 Just a little bit of foreshadowing,

29
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,300
 if P is prime, what does that tell you about Z?

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,130
 Well, these- Z's are all relatively prime to P. So,

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,690
 what does that imply?

32
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,050
 What that implies that these Zs all have an inverse mod

33
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,820
 P. That's the key thing about a prime number P and that's going to come out in the proof.

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,610
 One last historical note.

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,000
 This is Fermat's little theorem,

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,590
 it's not Fermat's last theorem.

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,405
 Fermat's last theorem is the one

38
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,730
 which he claimed to have a proof and he couldn't fit it into

39
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,350
 the margin and which was proofed roughly 400 years later by Andrew Wiles,

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,145
 after 10 years of hard work.

41
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:50,325
 So, this Fermat's little theorem is quite easy to prove and we're going to prove it now.

42
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:53,540
 We'll go through the proof of Fermat's last theorem in the homework.

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,540
 Don't worry, we'll give you a few hints.
