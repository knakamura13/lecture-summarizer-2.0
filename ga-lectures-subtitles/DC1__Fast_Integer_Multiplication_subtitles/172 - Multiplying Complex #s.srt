1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,715
 Before we dive into our example of multiplying n-bit integers.

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:05,735
 Let's take a brief digression.

3
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:08,310
 We're going to look at how clever idea from Gauss.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,258
 It's not at all going to be apparent how this is useful for our multiplication for

5
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:14,700
 example but it will turn out to be

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,755
 a very useful idea which will give us an improved algorithm.

7
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:19,410
 Here's a setting that we're working in,

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,760
 multiplication is expensive, so we want to minimize the number of multiplications.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,265
 Adding and subtracting is relatively cheap,

10
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:29,435
 so we're not going to worry about the number of additions and subtractions.

11
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,685
 So we're willing to add in additional additions

12
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:36,250
 and subtractions in order to reduce the number of multiplications.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,610
 Now, this fact that multiplications are expensive,

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,710
 and additions and subtractions are much cheaper is true in most cases.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,375
 For example, when we're looking at multiplying n-bit integers,

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,935
 multiplying them takes order n squared time

17
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:53,070
 whereas if we're adding or subtracting it takes order n time.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,730
 Now, here's the problem of Gauss.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,070
 We're given two complex numbers.

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,260
 How do I give you the complex number?

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,865
 I have to tell you the real and the imaginary part.

22
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,220
 So the first number is a + bi,

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,335
 a is the real part,

24
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:05,890
 b is the imaginary part.

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,610
 And the second number is c + di,

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,545
 c is the real part, d is the imaginary part.

27
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,420
 And our goal is to compute their product.

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,265
 We want to compute (a + bi) times (c + di).

29
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:17,670
 Well, in order to get a handle on it,

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,595
 let's start by just expanding this out.

31
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:23,225
 So I get a times c, like bi times di,

32
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,260
 i squared is negative one,

33
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,650
 so that gives me minus bd.

34
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,975
 And then, I get two terms which are multiplied by i,

35
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:34,575
 the first is b times c and the second is a times d.

36
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:39,370
 In order to compute this product it looks like we need to compute a time c,

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,435
 b times d, b times c,

38
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,600
 and a times d. Now each of these a,

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,555
 b, c, and d are just real numbers.

40
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,805
 So it looks like we need four real number multiplications.

41
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:55,410
 We need to compute a times c, b times d,

42
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,700
 b times c, a times d. If you give me these real number multiplications,

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,040
 then with one, two,

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,935
 three additions or subtractions,

45
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:11,910
 we can combine these products in order to get the product of these two complex numbers.

46
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,445
 Now our setting is that multiplications are expensive.

47
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:19,440
 So we're trying to minimize the number of multiplications and we're willing to have

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,455
 additional additions or subtractions in order to reduce the number of multiplications.

49
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,743
 So, can we reduce the number of multiplications?

50
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,885
 Can we get it down from four?

51
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:33,825
 Is it possible to achieve this product with only three multiplications?

52
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,310
 It turns out we can do it.

53
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,245
 The key is that we're going to compute this sum,

54
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,800
 b times c plus a times d,

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,920
 we'll compute the sum without computing the individual terms.

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,900
 So we're not going to compute b times c and we're not going to compute

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:46,900
 a times d but we're going to compute their sum bc + ad.
