What is Euler's Theorem tell us for the case when N equal P times Q, where P and Q are prime numbers? For any Z which is relatively prime to N, which means that the GCD of Z and N is one, and if we take Z raised to the power phi of N, which is P minus one, Q minus one, we get back one_mod_N, which is P_times_Q. This fact here, is going to be the basis for the RSA algorithm. We're going to generate a pair of prime numbers, P and Q. And we're going to look at P_times_Q, and we're going to have a message, and we're going to use this P_minus_one, Q_minus_one, to generate a encryption key and the decryption key, and this is going to give us a basic fact, which is going to allow the encryption and decryption. Let's investigate this a little bit more and then will see the basic idea of the RSA algorithm.
