Fermat's Little Theorem states that for a prime p and any integer z between 1 and p-1, z^(p-1) mod p equals 1. To prove this, we define set S containing integers 1 through p-1. S' is another set created by multiplying each element in S by z and taking mod p. Through an example with p=7 and z=4, we see S' is a permutation of Sâ€”different order but contains the same elements. Establishing that S and S' are permutations of one another is a step towards proving the theorem.
