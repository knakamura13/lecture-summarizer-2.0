1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,435
 So let's dive into the reduction.

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,150
 So let's take a particular input for the feasible flow problem.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,490
 This is specified by a directed graph G,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,970
 capacities along the edges and demands along the edges.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,930
 Now we need this to construct an input for the max flow problem.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,280
 This is specified by a directed graph which we'll call

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,410
 G prime and capacities along the edges which was specified by C prime.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,560
 Now these capacities don't have to be the same as the original capacities.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,435
 In fact, we need these capacities to

10
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:30,225
 encode not just the capacities in the original graph,

11
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,850
 but also the demands in the original graph.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,376
 Let's take a look at a particular example, very simple example,

13
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:39,120
 here's a small example of four vertices,

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,070
 this is our directed graph G,

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,645
 which is our input to the feasible flow problem.

16
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:47,555
 That specified some example capacities and demands.

17
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,835
 We've written a pair of numbers for each edge.

18
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:52,020
 The first number, for example three,

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,430
 specifies the demand, and the second number specifies the capacity.

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,695
 Now let's try to create a graph G prime.

21
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,858
 Well we want to keep all this information,

22
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:05,170
 so we're going to keep the same graph G and we're going to add additional vertices to it.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,810
 So this is going to be our directed graph

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,264
 G prime which is going to be the input to the max flow problem.

25
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:13,105
 So we're going to start with the same graph G that

26
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:16,110
 was the input to the feasible flow problem and we're going to add

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,767
 a new start vertex which will denote is as

28
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:22,690
 prime and a new n vertex which will denote as t prime.

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,725
 So the original s and t will now serve as internal vertices.

30
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:29,855
 Now these are the vertices of this new graph G prime.

31
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:32,610
 Let's now look at the edges that are in this graph and

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:32,610
 also the capacities and along the edges in this new graph.
