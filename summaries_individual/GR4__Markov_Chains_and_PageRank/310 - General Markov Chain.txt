Markov chains consist of N states, often a large number such as the total webpages on the internet in PageRank's case. The states are represented as nodes in a weighted directed graph, numbered from 1 to N. The relationships between them are illustrated through an adjacency matrix called the transition matrix P. Entries in matrix P, denoted by P I J, signify the probability of transitioning from state I to state J. This matrix is stochastic, meaning each row adds up to one, indicating total probability distribution across possible next states from any given state, but the columns do not necessarily add up to one unless the matrix is doubly stochastic.
