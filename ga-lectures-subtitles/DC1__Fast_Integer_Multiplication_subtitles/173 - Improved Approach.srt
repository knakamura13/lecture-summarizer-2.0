1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,575
 So to recap, we have these two complex numbers: a+bi and c+di,

2
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:07,795
 and we want to compute their product.

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,630
 Now our goal is to minimize the number of

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,980
 real number multiplications in order to compute the product of these two complex numbers.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,313
 We just saw that the naive approach has four real number multiplications: ac,

6
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:23,670
 bd and bc and ad.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,725
 Now what we want to do is we want to try to achieve

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,820
 just three real number of multiplications in order to compute this product.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,405
 What we're going to do now is we're going to try to compute this sum,

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:39,585
 bc + ad without computing the individual terms bc and ad.

11
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:42,457
 That's going to leave us with a method for computing the product of

12
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:47,505
 these two complex numbers with just three real number multiplications needed.

13
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,765
 How are we going to get this as a term, bc + ad?

14
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:53,470
 Well, notice it kind of looks like a cross terms.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,405
 So let's write out the correct expression so that these are the cross terms.

16
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:02,440
 In order to achieve this, we need to have b on one side and c on the other side.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,260
 And we need to have a on one side and d on the other side.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,615
 So one side has b and a and the other side has c and d. Expand this out.

19
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:16,815
 Notice these two terms bc + ad is exactly what we're trying to compute.

20
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,430
 What about these other two terms ac and bd?

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,440
 Notice, these are exactly the products that

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,820
 we're computing in order to compute the product of these two complex numbers.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,410
 Let's look back at this expression.

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,365
 We're trying to compute this sum, bc + ad.

25
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,835
 So let's solve it for this term.

26
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:36,240
 If we solve it for bc + ad,

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,855
 then we get that that's equal to (a +

28
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:47,265
 b)(c+d) - ac - bd.

29
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:51,405
 Here's the key now, in order to compute this product of these two complex numbers,

30
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:55,405
 what are the three now real number multiplications that we need?

31
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:58,905
 Well one of them is ac, just like before.

32
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:02,825
 The second one that we need is just like before is bd.

33
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:07,090
 The third term that we want to obtain is bc + ad, that's right here.

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,780
 How can we obtain it? Well let's use this expression.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,240
 Look, ac we already know,

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,565
 bd we already know.

37
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,170
 What's the third thing we need?

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,170
 We need (a + b)(c + d).

39
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,855
 This is the third real number multiplication that we need.

40
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:24,885
 If we compute these three terms ac,

41
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:31,020
 bd and (a + b)(c + d) then from those we can compute these three terms,

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,295
 ac, bd, and bc + ad.

43
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:40,090
 So the punchline is, if we compute these three real number multiplications, ac, bd,

44
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,890
 and (a + b)(c + d) then by just doing some additions and some subtractions,

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,805
 we can obtain the product of these two complex numbers.

46
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:53,760
 It turns out we're going to utilize this idea in order to

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,850
 multiply the n-bit integers faster than order and square time.

48
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,955
 But before we dive back into that problem,

49
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:04,130
 I want to make sure that you appreciate the cleverness of this algorithm.

50
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,825
 It's really quite amazing. I mean look at what you're computing here.

51
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:10,585
 You're taking (a + b)(c + d).

52
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:15,900
 Now, one of the complex numbers that you're inputting is a + bi. So what are you doing?

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,350
 You're taking the real part and the imaginary part and you're adding those

54
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,365
 up and that gives you a new real number, a + b.

55
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,140
 Why would you consider looking at this number,

56
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,070
 a + b or this number c + d?

57
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,370
 Why would you consider taking

58
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,300
 the real and imaginary part of the same number and adding those up?

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,360
 Somehow by looking at the real plus the imaginary part for both of

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,420
 these complex numbers and multiplying those together that gives

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,460
 us a way for computing the product of

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,895
 these two complex numbers faster or at least using fewer multiplications.

63
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,690
 Just think about it for a specific example.

64
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,525
 Let's say you're trying to compute (5 + 3i)(7 - 6i).

65
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,025
 What are you using here?

66
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,980
 Using 8 x 1.

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,030
 So why would you think to use 8 and 1 from

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,420
 these numbers in order to compute the product of these two complex numbers?

69
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,420
 It's really quite
