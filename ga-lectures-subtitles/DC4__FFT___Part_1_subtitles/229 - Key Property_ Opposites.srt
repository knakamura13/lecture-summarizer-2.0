00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,005
 There are two key properties of the nth roots of unity which we're going to utilize.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,050
 The first holes for even n,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,030
 the nth root satisfies the plus minus property.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,220
 This was the key property for our divide and conquer approach.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,385
 The first n over two of the nth roots of unity are opposite of the last n over two.

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,280
 In other words, omega sub n to the zero power

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,555
 equals negative omega sub n to the n over two.

8
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:28,005
 And in general, omega sub n to the jth power equals

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,460
 negative omega sub n to the n over two plus j.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,975
 So the nth roots of unity look like a perfect choice for our divide and conquer approach,

11
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:36,975
 because they satisfy the plus minus property.
