1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
 So here's our current proposed solution.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,030
 So instead of setting the rank of the page X to be the number of in neighbors,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,255
 the number of links into X,

4
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:14,875
 we've scaled each of those links by the number of out neighbors from that page y.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,520
 Now there are some obvious problems with this let's look at one example.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,985
 Let's suppose that my kids made a web page

7
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:24,320
 and it has only one link on it, to my web page.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,880
 So under this count, I get one citation for it and now let's look at CNN web page.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,720
 They probably have many links on their web page but perhaps they have an article about

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,285
 Kishore's awesome new research and they have a link to Kishore's web page.

11
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,810
 So if they have 100 links,

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,850
 Kishore is going to get one over a hundredth of

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,680
 a citation here whereas I'm going to get one citation.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,570
 Now this doesn't seem very fair because CNN's web page is very important.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,840
 So we should scale this citation from CNN based on the importance of CNN's web page.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,420
 So instead of a web page having one citation to give out

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,415
 the web pages should have PI it's rank to give out.

18
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:06,845
 So CNN should have Pi of CNN its rank,

19
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:09,415
 that's how many citations it has to give out

20
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,805
 or that's the worth of its citations to give out.

21
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,960
 Now we can scale each of those citations as we did

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,110
 before based on how many links CNN has.

23
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,065
 So CNN has 1000 links in each of these web pages which has a link from it,

24
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:27,710
 is going to get one over thousands of CNN's worth.

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,482
 So CNN total citation value is Pi over CNN,

26
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:36,345
 that's its rank and then each web page that has a link from it,

27
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:41,670
 is going to get one over thousands of that worth, the recommendation value.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,210
 So a citation from a more important web page,

29
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,610
 has more value because it's going to be

30
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:46,610
 proportional to the value the rank of the web page.
