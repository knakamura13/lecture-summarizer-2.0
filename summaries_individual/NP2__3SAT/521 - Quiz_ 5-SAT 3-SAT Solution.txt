Construct a clause in three literals from a clause with K literals using K-3 new vars and K-2 clauses. Begins by assigning one literal's complement (X_1_bar) to satisfy one clause, then set auxiliary vars Y, Z appropriately to satisfy remaining clauses. Reverse by considering assignments for Y, Z, and infer the assignment for original clause C using Y's and Z's truth values. This method ensures at least one literal in each clause of C_prime corresponds to a literal in C; satisfying C_prime will also satisfy C by appropriate assignments. Generalize this by creating new vars and clauses based on the clause size K, where size four needs one new var and for five, two new vars. This construction maintains the satisfaction relationship between the original and constructed sets of clauses.
