1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
 Here again, is our earlier example of a Markov chain with four states.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,485
 This is a weighted graph.

3
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:07,800
 But for a moment let's ignore the edge ways and

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,685
 let's look at the unweighted version of this graph.

5
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:12,270
 Here's the adjacency matrix,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,595
 where this unweighted version of this graph.

7
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:20,620
 From State 1, there are edges to itself to State 2 and that's it.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,115
 So the first row looks like 1 1 0 0,

9
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:28,170
 and is straightforward to check the remainder of the adjacency matrix.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,580
 Now, I want to look at the matrix, A square.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,980
 So A times A.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,450
 This is still going to be a four by four matrix.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,490
 Let's simply multiply it out, and what do we get?

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,820
 I claim that this is the matrix A square.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,120
 What do these entries mean?

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,335
 Well, take a look at this first entry, 1 1.

17
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,050
 It has value 2, why?

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,745
 Well, because there are two pass going from State 1 to State 1 of Lane 2 In particular,

19
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:54,277
 I can self loop and then self loop,

20
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:57,115
 or I can go to State 2 and then back to State 1.

21
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:59,980
 Take another State, four comma one.

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,945
 From State 4, look at the pass of Lane 2 to State 1.

23
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:08,650
 I can self loop and then follow this edge or I can follow this edge, and then self loop.

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,145
 But if I look at from four to two, what can I do?

25
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,820
 Well, there's only one path of Lane 2.

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,180
 I can go to State 1 and then over to State 2,

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,785
 and if I look at the pass of length two from 4 to 3,

28
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:23,995
 where there are no pass of Lane 2 that go from State 4 to State 3.

29
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:29,280
 There's no way to reach 3 from 4 by path of Lane 2.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,745
 So this matrix A square encodes the number of pass of Lane 2.

31
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:36,490
 Now let's go back to the weighted version of this graph.

32
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,815
 This is the transition matrix for this Markov chain.

33
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:42,760
 Let's write the transition matrix once again for this Markov chain.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,190
 I got half probability of staying at State 1,

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,190
 half probability of going from State 1 to State 2,

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,675
 and then zero probability of going from State 1 to State 3 or State 4.

37
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,630
 So this is the first row.

38
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,125
 This is the remainder of the transition matrix.

39
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,140
 We're going to look at this matrix, P square,

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,720
 which is P times P. Well let's simply multiply it out first and see what matrix we get.

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,466
 Well if we multiply out P times P,

42
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:11,005
 this is the matrix P square that we get. What are these entries mean?

43
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,850
 Well one thing we noticed first,

44
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,620
 is that we get a 0 entry here,

45
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,955
 and we also had a zero entry in the matrix A square. But why is that?

46
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,400
 Well, there's no passive Lane 2 in this graph,

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,680
 from State 4 to State 3.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,275
 So this entry four, three is 0.

49
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:29,155
 These other entries there are no longer integer values,

50
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:33,775
 so they no longer correspond to the number of pass between this pair, I J.

51
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:38,650
 But they too correspond to the total weight of the pass, from I to J.

52
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,365
 Suppose we start the Markov Chain at time zero,

53
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,915
 in State 2, checking email.

54
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:47,640
 And I ask, what is the state at time t=2?

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,335
 Two time steps away.

56
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,350
 Well, one time step away is defined by the matrix P. Now let's

57
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,290
 look more precisely at the probability of going from State 2 at time zero,

58
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,760
 to State 1 at time two.

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,750
 So what's this probability of going from State 2 to State 1,

60
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,465
 in two time steps?

61
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:06,930
 Well, there are two ways to do it.

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,890
 I can go from 2 to 1,

63
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,553
 and then self loop,

64
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:13,870
 or I can go 2 to 4 and then to 1.

65
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,494
 The probability of going from State 2 to State 1 is point 2,

66
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:22,325
 and then from 1 to 1 self looping is point 5 probability.

67
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:26,370
 The other path has probability point 3 times .7.

68
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,130
 Now if you work this out, what do you get?

69
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,800
 You get point 31,

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,425
 which is exactly the entry two one in this matrix P square.

71
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,225
 So in this matrix P square,

72
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,750
 at the entry I J,

73
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,750
 tells us the probability of going from State I to state J in exactly two times steps.
