1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
 The input once again is specified by

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,520
 an undirected graph G where the vertices correspond to the pixels.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,890
 And in addition, we have the following parameters;

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,230
 for each pixel, we have two parameters, fi and bi.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,284
 Fi is the likelihood or weight that vertex i,

6
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:17,520
 pixel i is in the foreground.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,825
 And bi is the weight or likelihood that pixel i is in the background.

8
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,705
 Now, we'll assume that both of these parameters are non-negative.

9
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:29,035
 In addition, we're given a parameter for each pair of neighboring pixels.

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,520
 Pij is a separation penalty for this edge.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,670
 It's the cost of separating i and j into different objects.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:36,670
 And once again, we'll assume that pij is not negative.
