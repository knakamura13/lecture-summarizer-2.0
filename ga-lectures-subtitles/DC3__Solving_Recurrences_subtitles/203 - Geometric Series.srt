1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
 Consider some positive constant alpha.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,890
 In our previous example alpha was 4 over 2 and we're looking at this geometric series.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,225
 We're summing over J going from zero to k of alpha to the j.

4
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,960
 Expanding this out we have 1 plus alpha plus

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,405
 alpha squared and so on up to alpha to the j.

6
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:22,410
 Now since we are solving our recurrences within big O notation,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,170
 we don't need to solve this expression exactly.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,975
 We simply need to solve it within constant factors,

9
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:30,420
 so that makes life much easier.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,850
 Now the key for a geometric series is to figure out

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,895
 which term dominates either the first term,

12
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:38,630
 the last term or all terms are equal.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,205
 The three cases are whether alpha is bigger than 1,

14
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,470
 equal to 1 or less than 1.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,150
 Now if alpha is bigger than 1,

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,111
 then each term is growing,

17
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,190
 so the last term is going to dominate.

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,125
 So the whole expression is going to be on the order of the last term.

19
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,890
 Conversely, if alpha is less than 1 then

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,568
 the terms are decreasing and the first term dominates,

21
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:04,155
 so the whole expression is on the order of the first term, so it's order 1.

22
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:08,130
 Finally, the middle case is if alpha equals one then every term

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,330
 is exactly 1 and then the number of terms is k plus 1,

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,395
 so the whole thing is on the order of k.

25
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:17,580
 This first case where alpha is bigger than 1

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,170
 is what arises in the recurrence we just analyzed.

27
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,570
 In that case alpha equals 2 and what we saw there was that the last term dominates.

28
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,130
 When we look at merge sort,

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,973
 then we'll have alpha equals one,

30
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:32,840
 all the terms will be the same and we'll get an order again from that.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,050
 The final case is what arises in the example of the median finding algorithm,

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,110
 there we'll have alpha equals three quarters so

33
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,110
 the geometric series which arises will be on the order of 1.
