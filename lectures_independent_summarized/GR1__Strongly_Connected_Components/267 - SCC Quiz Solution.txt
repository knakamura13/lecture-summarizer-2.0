Graph has five strongly connected components (SCCs): A alone, BE together, CFG together, D alone, HIJKL together. A, a SCC due to no incoming paths from other vertices. J within its SCC can reach and be reached by all others. D, a SCC since it can't reach any vertices. Meta vertices created to represent each SCC show directed edges between SCCs, like between CFG and HIJKL due to an edge from F to I, revealing interesting properties in a graph of SCC meta vertices.
