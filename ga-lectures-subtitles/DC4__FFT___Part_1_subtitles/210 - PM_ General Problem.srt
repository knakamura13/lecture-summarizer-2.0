00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
 Once again, the general computational problem that we're considering is,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,088
 given this vector of coefficients for A of X,

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:09,765
 and this vector of coefficients defining B of X,

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:13,800
 we want to compute their convolution C. Now a simple algorithm for

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,030
 computing this convolution is going to compute each of these coefficients in turn.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,010
 Now there were order n coefficient.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,430
 How long did it take to compute each coefficient?

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,170
 Well a naive algorithm takes order K time to compute

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,475
 the Kth coefficient because there are order K terms that we have to sum up.

10
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:34,030
 This is going to lead to an order n squared time algorithm to compute all

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,835
 of the order n coefficients of the polynomial C of X.

12
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:41,220
 What we are going to do now in this lecture is an order n log

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,660
 n time algorithm for computing this product polynomial C of X,

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:44,660
 the convolution of a_n.
