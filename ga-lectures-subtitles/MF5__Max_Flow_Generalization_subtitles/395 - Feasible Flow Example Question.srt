00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,175
 Let us take a look at one of our flow network examples from earlier.

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:06,390
 And let us look at the feasible flow problem in this example.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,475
 So here is a directed graph with the specified start and end vertex.

4
00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:13,620
 Let's mark the demand and the capacities along every edge.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,900
 The green numbers specify the demand along

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,295
 the edge and the red numbers specify the capacity along the edge.

7
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:24,255
 So along this edge we want the flow to be at least two units and at most eight units.

8
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:26,940
 Along this edge, there is no demand constraint.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,700
 It has got to be at least zero and at most three.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,675
 Here it has got to be at least three and at most six.

11
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:32,675
 Is there a feasible flow for this example?
