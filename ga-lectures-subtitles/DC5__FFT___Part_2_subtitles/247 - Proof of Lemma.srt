1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,345
 Now let's go back to proving the lemma.

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:06,630
 We're trying to show that the inverse of this matrix M is one over

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,795
 n times this matrix M parameterized by omega sub n to the negative one.

4
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:16,275
 So the inverse of this nth root of unity,

5
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:19,920
 which we saw before is omega sub n to the n minus one,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,225
 but it will be more convenient to treat it as omega sub n to the negative one.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:29,610
 Now rewriting this, so multiply both sides by the matrix capital

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,785
 M. This side becomes the identity matrix, capital I,

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:40,140
 and the right hand side becomes one over n times M parameterized by

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,615
 omega sub n to the negative one times M parameterized by omega sub n. Now,

11
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,700
 what is the identity matrix?

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,930
 Well, this has ones on the diagonal and zeros off the diagonal.

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,350
 So let's look at the product of

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,770
 these two matrices and we're going to look at the diagonal entries of

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,225
 this product and show that those are

16
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:05,245
 n and the off diagonals we're going to show are zeros.

17
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,800
 So to recap, we have to show that

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,535
 the product of these two matrices, the diagonal entries,

19
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:16,255
 are n because one over n times these products should be ones,

20
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,537
 and the off diagonal entries,

21
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,220
 so for k not equal to j,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,687
 the entry k, j,

23
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,780
 these should be zeros.

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,070
 So we'll have two cases,

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,070
 the diagonal entries and the off diagonal entries.
