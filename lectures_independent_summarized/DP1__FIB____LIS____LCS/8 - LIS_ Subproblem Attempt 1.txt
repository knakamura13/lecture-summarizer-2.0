Designing a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm involves a standard recipe. First, define sub-problems; for Fibonacci numbers, this means identifying the i-th number in the sequence (F(i)). Next, establish a recursive relation connecting the solution of a sub-problem to smaller instances; F(i) is the sum of F(i-1) and F(i-2). Applying this to the longest increasing subsequence problem, define L(i) as the length of the longest increasing subsequence within the first i elements. The challenge then lies in expressing L(i) in terms of L(1) to L(i-1). Understanding how to construct this relationship is key for successfully applying DP to a given problem.
