Proving the reverse implication shows that a satisfying assignment for C' guarantees a satisfying assignment for C. For C' satisfied by an assignment of K literals plus auxiliary variables, we assume all K literals are false and deduce a contradiction, thereby invalidating the assumption. Initial clauses necessitate setting auxiliary variables Y1 to Yk-3 to true. But with these and all K literals false, the last clause fails, contradicting C' satisfaction. This means at least one K literal must be true, satisfying C, independent of auxiliary variable assignments.
