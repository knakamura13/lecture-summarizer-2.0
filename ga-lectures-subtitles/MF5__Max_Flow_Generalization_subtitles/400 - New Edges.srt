1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,775
 So what we've done so far in our reduction is for each edge in

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:08,430
 the original network G. We've added that edge to this new network G-prime,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,550
 and the capacity of that edge in the new network is

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,295
 the original capacity shifted by the demand.

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:18,380
 Now we're going to have to add additional edges to this graph.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,020
 Let's get some intuition for what these additional edges have to accomplish.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,240
 Now we want a valid flow here in this graph

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,690
 G-prime to correspond to a feasible flow here.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,110
 So suppose we have a zero flow here.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,060
 So we have flow zero from s to a,

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,513
 zero from a to b, and zero from a to

12
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:39,850
 t. Now what is that going to correspond to over here?

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,520
 Well, zero flow along this edge is going to correspond to flow three along this edge.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,185
 Zero here is going to correspond to flow one here,

15
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:51,525
 and zero here is going to correspond to flow seven here,

16
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:56,080
 because the minimum flow here is going to correspond to the minimum flow here.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,075
 Now certainly zero flow here is valid.

18
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:03,110
 The flow into a is zero and the flow out of a is zero.

19
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,880
 But over here, we have flow in of three units and we have flow out of eight units.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,745
 So it's not a valid flow over here.

21
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:13,790
 The flow into a does not equal the flow out of a.

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,355
 So we need to offset that somehow in this graph so that

23
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:21,880
 a valid flow here will correspond to at least a valid flow here.

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,335
 We're going to accomplish that by adding an edge from

25
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:27,840
 s-prime to each of these vertices of the original network,

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,935
 and from each of these vertices of the original network to t-prime will have an edge.

27
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:34,920
 Let's look first at the edges from

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,825
 s-prime to each of the vertices of the original network.

29
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:40,245
 So for each vertex in the original network,

30
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:43,470
 we add this edge from s-prime to v. Now,

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,148
 what is the capacity of this edge from s-prime to v in this new network G-prime?

32
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:52,260
 Well, we shifted the capacity along this edge into a

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,800
 by three units corresponding to the demand into a.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,070
 We want to offset that by this edge from s-prime to a.

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,740
 So we're going to define the capacity of this edge to be the demand into

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,320
 the vertex v. So the total demand into

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,920
 the vertex a in the original network is three units.

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,015
 So the capacity of this edge from s-prime to a will be three units.

39
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:23,150
 Now t has total demand in of seven plus two, so nine units.

40
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,605
 So this edge will have capacity nine,

41
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:29,045
 b has demand in five units,

42
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,230
 so this edge has capacity five,

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,630
 and s, of course,

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,505
 has zero demand in.

45
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:36,740
 So this edge has zero capacity.

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,540
 Similarly, we are going to add edges from each of

47
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,390
 these vertices of the original network to t-prime.

48
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,950
 Now we'll put these in a different color just to

49
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,800
 differentiate them from the edges from s-prime.

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,280
 So we have s to t-prime,

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,004
 a to t-prime, t to t-prime and b to t-prime.

52
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:59,745
 What is the capacity of these edges to the vertex t-prime?

53
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:02,880
 Well, from s-prime, that captured the demand

54
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,150
 into the vertex v and these edges to t-prime are

55
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,900
 going to capture the demand out of the vertex v. So vertex s has demand out of seven,

56
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,150
 so this edge has capacity seven.

57
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,040
 Vertex a has total demand out of eight,

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,380
 so this edge has capacity eight.

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,255
 T, of course, has zero demand out,

60
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:27,920
 and b, in this example,

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,530
 has demand out of two.

62
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,000
 So, that fully specifies our graph G-prime which is our input to the max-flow problem.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,850
 Now we have to discuss how a solution to

64
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:37,850
 this max-flow instance corresponds to a solution to the feasible flow problem.
