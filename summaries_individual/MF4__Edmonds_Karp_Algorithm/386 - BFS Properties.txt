Key lemma states an edge in the residual graph is deleted and reinserted â‰¤ n/2 times. To prove it, we use BFS properties, which operates on directed/undirected graphs without considering edge weights. BFS starts at vertex s and outputs an array of size n, where dist(v) is the min number of edges from s to v, ignoring edge weights. For weighted edges, Dijkstra's algorithm is needed. BFS also determines the shortest path from s to v using the fewest edges.
