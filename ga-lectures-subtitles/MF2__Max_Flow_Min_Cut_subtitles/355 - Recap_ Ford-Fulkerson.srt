1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,505
 The input to the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm,

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:06,140
 or to the Max flow problem in general, is a flow network.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,210
 This is a directed graph G with

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,205
 a specified star and N vertex S and T. And for each edge of the graph,

5
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:16,992
 where specified a positive capacity C_sub_e.

6
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:20,015
 Now, if you recall for the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm,

7
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:21,885
 to analyze the running time,

8
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:25,030
 we required that the capacities were integer value.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,480
 Let's ignore that assumption for now and let's look at the more general Max flow problem.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,955
 The output for the algorithm or for the Max flow problem is a flow of maximum size.

11
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:39,540
 And recall that the size of the flow is the flow out of

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,370
 the source vertex or the flow into the sync vertex T. Now recall,

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,420
 we analyzed the running time of the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm but we didn't prove that

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,395
 the flow that's outputted by the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm is of maximum size.

15
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,085
 So let's look at that now.

16
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:58,110
 What do we know about this flow that's outputted by the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm?

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,563
 In particular, when did the Ford–Fulkerson stop?

18
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:04,390
 What is the stopping condition for the algorithm?

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,795
 The algorithm stops when we look at the residual graph for the current flow.

20
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:12,790
 So this is G superscript f-star.

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,130
 Now in this residual graph,

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,495
 we look for a path from s to t. Such a path is called an augmenting path.

23
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:20,955
 If there's no augmenting path,

24
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,165
 there's no path from s to t in this residual graph,

25
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,010
 then the algorithm stops.

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,450
 We have no way to augment the flow to get a bigger flow.

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,165
 We're going to prove the following general lemma: for a flow f-star,

28
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:39,960
 If there's no augmenting path in the residual graph G superscript f-star,

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,120
 then its flow is a Max flow.

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,340
 So if in the residual graph there's no path from s to t,

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,340
 then this flow is a Max flow.
