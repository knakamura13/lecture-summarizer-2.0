Now, how can we check whether our LP is feasible or infeasible? And if it is feasible, how can we check whether it's unbounded or not? Let's first address how we determine whether it's feasible or not, and later in the lecture, we'll address whether it's unbounded or not. To figure out whether a feasible LP is unbounded or bounded, we're going to have to look at the dual LP. So we'll defer that discussion until after we discuss duality. Let's look now at how we determine whether an LP is infeasible.
