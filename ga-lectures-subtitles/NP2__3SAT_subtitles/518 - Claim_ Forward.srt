1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Now, let's go ahead and prove this claim,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,191
 so that we have some idea how to generalize this construction.

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,250
 Here's our original clause of size 4

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,770
 and here's our new pair of clauses each of size, the most three.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,520
 And we want to prove that this original clause C_2 is satisfiable,

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,760
 if and only if this new pair of clauses C'_2 is satisfiable.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,935
 Let's do the forward direction first.

8
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,290
 Let's take a satisfying assignment for C_2.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,230
 This is an assignment for x_2,

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,090
 x_3, x_1 and x_4,

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,090
 which satisfies this clause and we want to

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,385
 show that there is a satisfying assignment for C_2 prime.

13
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,790
 Now in order for this assignment to satisfy C_2,

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,815
 one of the four cases must hold.

15
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,110
 Either x_2 equals false,

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,650
 x_3 equals true, x_1 equals false or x_4 equals false.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,465
 Maybe some combination of those hold,

18
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,445
 but at least one of those has to hold.

19
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,175
 We'll break up these four cases into the following pair of cases.

20
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:59,470
 We'll consider whether x_2 equals false or x_3 equals true.

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,620
 These are the pair of literals which appear in the first clause of

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,900
 C'_2 and the other case is if x_1 equals false or x_4 equals false.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,120
 This is the pair of literals which appear in the second clause of C'_2.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,325
 Now if x_2 equals false or x_3 equals true,

25
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,125
 then we're going to set y to be false.

26
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,240
 Notice in this case,

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,030
 we have x_2 is false or x_3 is true.

28
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,940
 Therefore, the first clause is satisfied and we're setting Y to be false.

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,320
 So this satisfies the second clause.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,920
 C_2 prime is satisfied in this case.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,325
 Similarly in the second case,

32
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:35,980
 if x_1 is false or x_4 is false,

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,145
 then we set y to be true.

34
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:40,990
 In this case, since y is true,

35
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,760
 this satisfies the first clause.

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,470
 And since x_1 is false or x_4 is false this satisfies the second clause.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,930
 And given a satisfying assignment for C_2,

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:49,930
 we've constructed a satisfying assignment for C'_2.
