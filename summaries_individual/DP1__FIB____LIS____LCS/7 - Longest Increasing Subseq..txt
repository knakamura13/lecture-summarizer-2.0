Exploring the dynamic programming approach to solve the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LAS) problem, which involves determining the maximum length of an increasing sequence of numbers within a given list of N numbers (A1 to AN). The focus is on calculating the sequence's length, not the sequence itself, which simplifies the process of devising an algorithm to identify the sequence later. Unlike substrings that comprise consecutive elements from a larger string, subsequences are non-consecutive ordered selections from the string, with increasing subsequences defined by each element being strictly larger than its predecessor. For example, within a 12-number sequence, the longest increasing subsequence identified has a length of 6, composed of the following numbers: -3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9. Hence, the developed algorithm should output the length '6' for this instance. This sets the stage for creating a dynamic programming solution to efficiently compute the length of the longest increasing subsequences in such numerical inputs.
