Exploring an approximation algorithm for Max-SAT using Linear Programming (LP) and its variant, Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Start by reviewing LP in canonical form, optimizing CᵀX subject to constraints Ax ≤ b and non-negative X values. ILP adds a constraint: elements of vector X must be integers (Z to the N). Unlike LP, ILP forfeits the property of having an optimal vertex within the feasible region and, notably, is NP-hard, unlike polynomially solvable LP. To leverage these approaches for Max-SAT, reduce Max-SAT to an ILP form, then apply LP relaxation by dismissing the integer constraint, allowing for real numbers in X. This LP solution will guide us to a suitable, nearly optimal integer solution to the original ILP. This process outlines an approximation for Max-SAT, accepting the solution is potentially non-optimal due to the NP-hardness of ILP.
