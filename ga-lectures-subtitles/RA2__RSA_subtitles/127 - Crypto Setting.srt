1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
 Here's the general Crypto setting.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,825
 I got Alice over here and we got Bob over here.

3
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:08,085
 Alice has a message M, that she wants to send to Bob.

4
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:11,400
 Now, they have a communication line that they can talk over.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,970
 The problem is, that there's someone eavesdropping on this conversation.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:22,355
 So, whatever transmitted over this communication line can be seen in the clear by Eve,

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,265
 who's the eavesdropper on the communication.

8
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:29,870
 So, Eve sees everything in the clear that's communicated on this line.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,880
 So, Alice doesn't want to send the message by itself.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
 She wants to encrypt a message.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,946
 So, Alice is going to take the message M,

12
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:42,680
 she is going to feed that into the encryption scheme and out is going to pop E(M),

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,195
 the encrypted form of M, the message.

14
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,235
 She's going to send that along the transmission line.

15
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:51,060
 Bob, meanwhile is going to have his decryption box.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,065
 So, he's going to take this encrypted message,

17
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:55,685
 feed that as input into his decryption box,

18
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,650
 an arrow is going to pop the decrypted message.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,130
 Meanwhile, Eve what did she see?

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,790
 She sees this encrypted message,

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,740
 because that's what sent over this communication line.

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,530
 And, from the encrypted message,

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,680
 she doesn't know how to decrypt.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,580
 Only, Bob knows how to decrypt.

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,760
 Now, this is a public key cryptosystem.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,750
 By public key, we mean that

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,190
 no communication needs to be happen between Alice and Bob in private.

28
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,620
 So, they don't need to have any coordination beforehand.

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,160
 What's going to happen is, Bob is going to do a computation on his

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,925
 own and he's going to compute a public key and a private key.

31
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,355
 His public key is going to be two numbers,

32
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:37,395
 N capital N and and E. Capital N it's going to correspond to P times Q,

33
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:40,320
 the product of two primes and E is going to

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,588
 be some number which is relatively prime to P minus one times Q minus 1.

35
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,245
 He's going to announce to the world,

36
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,975
 N and E. Now,

37
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:53,075
 anybody that wants to send a message to Bob is going to take his public key.

38
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,613
 They're going to take their message and using M,

39
00:01:55,613 --> 00:02:01,050
 they're going to encrypt their message using N and E, the public key.

40
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,380
 But, the thing is only Bob knows how to

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,665
 decrypt messages that are encrypted using his public key.

42
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:12,620
 So, he's going to have a private key D, what is D?

43
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,835
 D is going to be the inverse of E mod P minus one times, Q minus one.

44
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:19,725
 Only he knows P and Q,

45
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:24,540
 so only he can compute D. He can compute D and then he can take

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,930
 this encrypted message and he can raises the power D and

47
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,830
 then take it mod N and that will give him the original message.

48
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,480
 But, only Bob knows how to compute this private key,

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,600
 so only he can do this decryption.

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,775
 But, there's no coordination that needs to happen between Alice and Bob.

51
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,825
 Bob does this computation on his own.

52
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:45,960
 He computes N and E and announces it to

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,515
 the world and he computes this private D and keeps it to himself.

54
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:54,430
 Meanwhile, anybody that wants to send a message to Bob looks up his public key,

55
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,145
 sees his N and E, he uses that to encrypt,

56
00:02:57,145 --> 00:03:00,265
 the sender encrypted message in the clear.

57
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:03,405
 So, anybody can see the encrypted message and then,

58
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,230
 only Bob can decrypt it.

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,540
 So, let's detail this scheme,

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:06,540
 this is a RSA cryptosystem.
