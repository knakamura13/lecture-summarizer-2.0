Finally, let's take a look at the writing time. We have this one for loop, which is a size order of capital B. Then, we have a nested for loop inside, it's of size order N. Each step, in this nested for loop, takes order one time. Therefore, the total run time is, order N times capital B. It's the same run-time as the original solution we had to this version. The space is smaller, and also it's simpler solution. It's a very simple algorithm, just a one dimensional table.
