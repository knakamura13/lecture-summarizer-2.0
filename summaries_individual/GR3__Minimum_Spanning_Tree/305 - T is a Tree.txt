Demonstrated that T prime (T') is a tree by constructing it from tree T, adding and removing edges to maintain n-1 edges. To prove T' is a tree, showed it's connected and has n-1 edges, conditions that define a tree. Connection established by identifying a path between any two vertices y and z in T' even after a specific edge (e') removal from T that initially connected y and z. This was achieved by using an alternate path (P') on the cycle created by adding edge e* to T. The alternate path P', which replaces e' in the original path P from y to z in T, ensures all vertices remain connected in T'. Therefore, T' remains connected with n-1 edges, affirming T' is a tree.
