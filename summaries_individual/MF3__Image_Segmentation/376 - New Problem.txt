New problem formulation involves an undirected graph representing an image. Each vertex I (pixel) has associated non-neg. weights fi and bi. Edges have non-neg. weight Pij. Aim to partition vertices into two sets, F and B, minimizing weight w' of FB, which also maximizes weight w of FB, thus addressing the original image segmentation problem. Next step: reduce this to a max flow problem.
