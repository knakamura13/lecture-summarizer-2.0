1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,590
 Now in a proof of dilemma about the inverse of the matrix M,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,670
 we're going to need the following claim which

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,040
 is a generalization of the quiz you just took.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,615
 The claim says that if we take any omega which is Nth root of unity.

5
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:16,095
 So omega raised to the nth is one,

6
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:20,250
 and we assume that omega is not one but any other root of unity.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,005
 And if we look at the sum of powers of omega.

8
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:28,890
 So one plus omega plus omega squared and so on up to omega to the N minus one,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,050
 then this sum equals zero.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,140
 Now we just saw that this is true when omega equals omega sub N and N is even.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,655
 We're going to need this more general claim so let's go ahead and prove it.

12
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:40,905
 Now first off though.

13
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,940
 Notice why it's not true when omega equals 1,

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,455
 when omega equals 1 then this is 1, 1, 1.

15
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:48,955
 All the terms are 1.

16
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:53,135
 So this is going to be N. it certainly does not equal to zero.

17
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,230
 Now let's forget about this claim for a second.

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,880
 For any number of Z the following holds,

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,010
 look at Z minus

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,600
 one times 1 plus Z plus Z squared up to Z to the N minus 1. So powers of Z.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,250
 So looks a little bit similar to the claim.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,140
 Multiply this out, what do you get?

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,640
 Well first two Z times this quantity.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,330
 So you get Z plus Z squared and so on up to Z

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,140
 to the N. And you've got negative 1 times this quantity.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,910
 So you have minus the same quantity.

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,474
 Notice most of the terms cancel each other out, Z minus Z,

28
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:29,640
 Z squared minus, there's the Z squared term there,

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,530
 Z to the N minus one minus Z to the N minus 1.

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,550
 What's left? The only term left here is the last term

31
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,555
 Z to the N and the only term left here is the first term, minus one.

32
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:45,150
 Now let Z equals omega from the hypothesis of the claim.

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,725
 What do we know? We know that omega is nth root of unity.

34
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:53,165
 So if we take omega or Z raised to the nth power, we get 1,

35
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:56,685
 so Z to the N minus one equals zero,

36
00:01:56,685 --> 00:02:04,620
 which means either this quantity equals zero or this quantity equals zero or both.

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,955
 But we assume that omega is not 1.

38
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,790
 So that means Z is not 1.

39
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,170
 So Z minus 1 is not 0.

40
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,670
 So that can't be the case.

41
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,495
 So this quantity must be equal to zero.

42
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:16,835
 That's what we're trying to prove.

43
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,030
 When Z equals omega.

44
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,700
 We're trying to prove that this sum equals zero.

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:20,700
 So that completes the proof.
