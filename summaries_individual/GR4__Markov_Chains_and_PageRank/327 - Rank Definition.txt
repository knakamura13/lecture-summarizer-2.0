Web page value based on rank; value from page y proportional to its rank (pi of y). Rank of page x derived from sum of all web pages y linking to x, with each y contribution scaled by its rank divided by its number of outgoing links. Definition of PageRank for page x isnâ€™t precise due to technicality revealed by Markov chains analysis. Proposing recursive definition for rank; questions about existence and uniqueness of pi for every web page (existence of a stationary distribution for Markov chain). Aim to ensure unique stationary distribution using Markov chain principles. Need to delve deeper into Markov chains to resolve issues in PageRank definition.
