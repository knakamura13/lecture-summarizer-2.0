To generate a multi-set that yields the optimal solution, tracking the last added object I is crucial. An array S is created, with S(b)=0 for the initial empty set solution. Upon updating the solution, if the condition is met, S(b) is set to I to indicate the optimal solution involves adding object I and considering the smaller subproblem. S allows for backtracking to construct a multi-set that achieves the maximum value. This process is akin to the method used for determining the longest common sub-sequence.
