Completed the development and time complexity analysis of a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. Initially defined the sub-problem to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) length of an array prefix. Unable to find a suitable recurrence relation with the initial sub-problem, reformulated it by adding an extra condition—this mimicked strengthening an inductive hypothesis in a mathematical proof by adding conditions, facilitating the formulation of a recurrence for the sub-problems. The revised sub-problem included the array element itself. The algorithm solves this strengthened version, determining the LIS with a specific ending character. Solving this facilitates addressing the original issue—finding the LIS irrespective of the ending character—by drawing parallels with induction proof techniques. This approach exemplifies common strategies in DP algorithm design and problem-solving.
