So, we're going to add a vertex S, a source vertex, corresponding to the foreground pixels. Now, here's the same directed graph, once again, with the vertices shrunk a little bit, just for illustrative purposes. Now, we're going to add two additional vertices, S and t. S will correspond to the foreground, t will correspond to the background, and this will be our source and our sync for our max-flow problem. We're going to add an edge from S to every pixel, every vertex. So, for every pixel in the original undirected graph, we add an edge from S to i. Now, S is supposed to correspond to the foreground. So, the capacity of this edge will be fi. So, we encode the foreground likelihoods.
