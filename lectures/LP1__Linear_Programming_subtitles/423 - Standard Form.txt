Let's look at the standard form for linear programs. We have n variables x1 through xn. Our objective function is to maximize a linear function of these n variables. We have these coefficients, c1 through cn, and we're maximizing this linear function of the n variables. We're optimizing subject to the m constraints. The first constraint is specified by a11 through a1n. These are the coefficients for x1 through xn. We want that this linear function is at most b1 for a given b1. This is the first constraint. There are n constraints. The mth constraint is specified by am1 through amn, that specifies the left hand side and we want this to be a most mn. And finally, we also have the non-negativity constraint. We want that these n variables are non-negative. We have m plus n constraints. We can specify this more compactly using linear algebra. Let's go ahead and do that.
