1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
 We just showed that if we delete an edge v to w from

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,430
 the residual network and later we add this edge back into the residual network,

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,075
 then the level of this vertex v increase by at least two.

4
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:19,373
 If we look at the level of vertex v before this deletion compared to after the insertion,

5
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,940
 the level of the vertex increase by at least two.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,940
 Now, what do we know about the level of vertices?

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,815
 The minimum level is zero,

8
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:28,110
 that's for vertex S itself.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,660
 The maximum level is n. Therefore,

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,150
 what's the maximum number of times that we can delete and

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,910
 then add this edge back into the residual network?

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,642
 We can delete it and then reinsert it back in at most n over two times.

13
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:42,600
 Since there m edges in the graph,

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,520
 this proves our main result that there is at

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,415
 most nm rounds in the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

16
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:47,415
 And that completes the analysis of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
