To securely select primes P and Q for cryptographic purposes, randomly choosing them ensures independence and security against those with prior access to prime tables. Random prime selection involves generating a random N-bit number R and testing for primality. R is determined by randomly assigning 0 or 1 to each bit, ensuring each bit and trial is independent. If R is prime, it's used; otherwise, the process repeats. Primes being numerically dense means the probability R is prime is roughly 1/N, so for large bit sizes like 1000 or 2000, a prime is expected after ~1000 or 2000 trialsâ€”a tolerable repetition rate. The remaining challenge concerns the primality test for R.
