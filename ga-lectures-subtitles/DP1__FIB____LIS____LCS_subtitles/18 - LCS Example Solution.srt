1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,430
 The solution is the substring BCBA,

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,070
 BCB A, which is the length four.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,020
 Why do we care about it? Well, I mean first off it's a nice example,

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,860
 which illustrates a slightly different flavor of the dynamic programming solution.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,910
 That's the main motivation here, but also,

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,970
 actually, this simple problem is used in Unix diff.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,490
 If you want to compare two files,

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,740
 you have this unique script diff,

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,665
 which compares two files and looks at the differences and it does

10
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:36,665
 utilizes the longest common subsequence dynamic programming algorithm.
