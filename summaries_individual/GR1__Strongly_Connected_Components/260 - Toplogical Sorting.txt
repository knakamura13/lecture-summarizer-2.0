DAGs, or directed acyclic graphs, lack cycles and thus exclude back edges in a DFS (depth-first search) tree. Useful for certain operations, like topological sorting, where vertices are arranged so that all directed edges flow from a vertex of lower order to one of higher order. By executing a DFS, we can facilitate a topological sort by arranging vertices in decreasing order of their post-order numbers, exploiting the fact that back edges do not exist, and post-order numbers decrease along edges in a DAG. With post-order numbers ranging between 1 and 2n, sorting can be optimized using an array of size 2n, allowing insertion and arrangement based on post-order numbers. The sorting step requires linear time, contrasting with the expected n log n time for typical sorting algorithms. Therefore, combined with the linear time (n plus m) required for DFS, the total time complexity for topologically sorting a DAG using this method is linear (N + M).
