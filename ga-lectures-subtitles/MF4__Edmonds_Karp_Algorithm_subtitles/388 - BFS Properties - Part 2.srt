1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
 Now, to approve our main demo about the number of rounds of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,320
 we're going to analyze the level of

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,175
 a vertex during the course of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,550
 Now, in particular we want to look at the vertex Z,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,530
 and we want to look at how it's level changes as the residual network changes.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,340
 Now, what can happen in the residual network?

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,915
 Well, edges can get deleted.

8
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:22,776
 For instance, suppose we delete this edge from A to D,

9
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:24,790
 then what happens to the level of D?

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,720
 Well, now the minimum number of edges to get from S to D is one, two, three.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,500
 So, D will be at level three.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,880
 So, the level of D will increase when we delete this edge from A to D. Now,

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,510
 we're also going to add edges into the residual network.

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,540
 For instance, what if we add an edge from B to D?

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,930
 Or maybe we'll even add this edge back from A to D,

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,580
 then will the level of D decrease back to level two.

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,590
 Well, we're going to prove that that does not occur.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,075
 Even though we're adding edges into the residual network sometimes,

19
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,955
 the level of vertex is never going to decrease.

20
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,325
 We're going to prove, that for every vertex Z,

21
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,300
 it's level over the course of the algorithm does not decrease.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,480
 It can stay the same or can increase in some levels.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,730
 But if for instance, this vertex D,

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,740
 it's level increases to three,

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,970
 then it can never go back down to two.

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,660
 It can only stay the same or increase further.

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,680
 Now, to prove this claim,

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,665
 we have to understand which edges are added into the residual network,

29
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:22,105
 and which edges are removed from the residual network.

30
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:22,105
 So, let's look at that in more detail.
