00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,485
 In this lecture, we're going to have two main tasks.

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:06,365
 The first task, is to prove the max-flow min-cut theorem.

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:10,740
 Later, we're going to use this theorem to solve the image segmentation problem.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,910
 Our second main task,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,760
 is to prove correctness of the Ford Fulkerson algorithm.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,990
 And in fact we will prove correctness of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm at the same time.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,790
 Now this is going to follow as a byproduct of the max-flow min-cut theorem.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,960
 Let's start with a quick overview of what we've seen

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:24,960
 so far for the Ford Fulkerson algorithm.
