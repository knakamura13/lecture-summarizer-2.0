1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
 This lesson is about the max flow problem.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,090
 First, we'll focus on algorithms for solving the max flow problem.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,400
 We'll start with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
 and then we'll look at the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,705
 Both of these algorithms are very simple,

6
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:17,045
 but the analysis of the running time of Edmonds-Karp algorithm is a bit more involved.

7
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:20,505
 After that, we're going to look at the very beautiful and very important theorem

8
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:23,530
 known as the max flow equals min-cut theorem.

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,440
 Now, this theorem will imply correctness of

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,445
 the Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,320
 It will also be key for several of our applications.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,850
 In particular, we'll look at solving

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,840
 the image segmentation problem using the max flow problem.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,210
 Now, in the image segmentation problem,

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,840
 we're given an image and we want to separate it

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,510
 into the foreground and background components.

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,780
 We'll solve this using

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:45,780
 the max flow problem and utilizing the max flow equals min- cut theorem.
