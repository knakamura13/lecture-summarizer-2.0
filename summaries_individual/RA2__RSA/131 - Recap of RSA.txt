RSA encryption is fundamentally based on number theory, relying on properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic. It utilizes Fermat's little theorem, which states that if you have a prime number p and another number z, with z and p being relatively prime (having a greatest common divisor of one), then z raised to the power of (p-1) and taken modulo p will equal one. However, RSA actually employs a generalization of this theorem, known as Euler's theorem. Specifically, RSA applies Euler's theorem to the product of two primes, p and q. In this scenario, if you take a number z that is relatively prime to N (where N is the multiplication of p and q) and raise z to the power of (p-1)(q-1), modulo N will also yield one. This power of (p-1)(q-1) is derived from the count of numbers between 1 and N that are relatively prime to N, where N is the product of two distinct prime numbers, p and q. Understanding this mathematical background is key to grasping RSA algorithm's encryption and decryption processes.
