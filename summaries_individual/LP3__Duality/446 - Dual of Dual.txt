Checking the duality in linear programming by considering a primal LP in canonical form and taking its dual twice. The primal LP maximizes C^TX subject to AX ≤ B, X ≥ 0. The first dual minimizes B^TY with constraints A^TY ≥ C, Y ≥ 0. To dualize this, we convert to canonical form: maximize -B^TY with -A^TY ≤ -C. Taking this LP's dual, we get max C^TZ, AZ ≤ B, Z ≥ 0, which matches the original primal's form, confirming the dual of the dual LP is the primal.
