1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
 Now we've seen the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for solving the max-flow problem.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,640
 And in this lecture, we'll look at

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,850
 the Edmonds-Karp algorithm for solving the max-flow problem.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,860
 Before we dive into the Edmonds-Karp algorithm,

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,600
 let's do a quick contrast of the two algorithms.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,750
 Now in the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm,

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,090
 the main step is to find augmenting paths which

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,840
 are paths from S to T in the residual graph and to do that,

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,320
 we either use DFS or BFS.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
 Now the running time of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is order M*C,

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,880
 and recall capital C,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,440
 is the size of the max-flow.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,465
 And recall that this running time analysis assume that the capacities are integer value.

14
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:40,940
 Now in contrast, Edmonds-Karp finds augmenting paths using BFS.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,685
 So Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an example of a Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

16
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:47,730
 Does the running time analysis for Ford-Fulkerson algorithms still

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,305
 applies to Edmonds-Karp algorithm when we assume integer capacities?

18
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:55,152
 But in fact, we can often make a stronger guarantee on the running time.

19
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:57,910
 We'll prove that the running time is order m-squared n,

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,840
 and this doesn't require that the capacities are integer values.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,970
 We have no assumptions on the capacities other than,

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,750
 of course, that they're positive valued.

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,360
 Now the algorithms are quite similar,

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,590
 so we'll give a quick recap with

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,600
 a Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and then we'll

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,165
 point out the differences in the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

27
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:13,680
 And then afterwards, we'll dive into

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 the running time analysis for the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
