1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
 So, let's go ahead and formalize this idea.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,425
 So, a citation from web page y,

3
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:10,910
 it's value is going to be proportional to the importance the rank of web page y.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,305
 So, we're going to scale this quantity by pi of y.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,560
 Formally, the rank of the web page x.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,280
 We're going to get it by looking at this sum over all web pages y,

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,825
 which have a link to x.

8
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:25,575
 The total value of the citations from y is pi of y.

9
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:29,310
 And y has this many outgoing links.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,380
 This is the number of out neighbors.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,215
 So, this link from y to x has value pi of y divided by the number of out neighbors of y.

12
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:41,975
 And this is going to be the definition of the page rank of web page x.

13
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,212
 Well, now to be precise,

14
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:46,540
 this is not exactly the definition of the page rank of a web page x.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,780
 There's a technical glitch that we'll notice by

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,425
 looking at this from the perspective of Markov chains.

17
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,650
 Before we dive back into Markov chains,

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,235
 let's look closely at this proposed definition of the rank.

19
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:58,700
 It's a recursive definition.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,890
 So, first off, is it well defined?

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,525
 Is there a pi satisfying it for every vertex x?

22
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:07,410
 This question of whether there exists a pi satisfying it,

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,240
 corresponds to whether there exists

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,165
 a stationary distribution for the corresponding Markov chain.

25
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:15,320
 Now, if there does exist such a pi,

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,900
 is there any unique such pi?

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,830
 Or are there multiple pis?

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,700
 This corresponds to the question of whether there is

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,595
 a unique stationary distribution or multiple stationary distributions.

30
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:28,880
 We'll address both of these questions using our intuition from Markov chains.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,560
 First, we'll derive this definition using

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,870
 Markov chains and then we'll see how to

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,080
 ensure that there is a unique stationary distribution.

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 So, let's dive back into Markov chains now.
