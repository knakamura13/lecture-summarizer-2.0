Complex number multiplication traditionally requires four real multiplications: ac, bd, bc, and ad. Goal: reduce to three real multiplications to calculate the product of two complex numbers, a+bi and c+di. Achieved by computing bc + ad, not individually but as part of an expression. The method: use the fact that bc + ad are the cross terms in the expansion of (a + b)(c + d). With expressions rearranged, bc + ad equals (a + b)(c + d) - ac - bd. The three necessary real multiplications are then: ac, bd, and (a + b)(c + d). These calculations allow us to determine ac, bd, and additively bc + ad to get the complex product. This reduction in multiplications applies not only to complex numbers but can accelerate multiplying large n-bit integers beyond the standard quadratic time. The essence of this approach is to consider the sum of the real and imaginary parts (a + b) and (c + d) of each complex number and multiply them to obtain a key term used to simplify the overall calculation, revealing the clever and efficient nature of the algorithm. An example with (5 + 3i)(7 - 6i) hints at using these sums, 8 and 1, to efficiently find the product.
