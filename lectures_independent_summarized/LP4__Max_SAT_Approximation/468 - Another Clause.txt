Examining a clause with both positive and negative literals: X1¬, X3, X2, X5¬. Objective: Determine Z (ZJ for clause J) value based on variable truth values—Y1 (1), Y3 (0), Y2 (0), Y5 (1). ZJ to be 0 when clause is unsatisfied. Positive literals summed normally; for negative literals, use complement (1 - Y). ZJ's maximum constrained by the sum of these adjustments. ZJ = 0 only if specific Y values match; otherwise, ZJ can be 0 or 1. Universal strategy involves identifying the positive (CJ+) and negative (CJ-) literals within a clause to properly constrain ZJ. In the example, CJ+ is X2 and X3; CJ- is X1 and X5.
