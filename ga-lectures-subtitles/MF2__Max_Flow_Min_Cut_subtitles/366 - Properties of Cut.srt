00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
 Let's take a look now at the properties of this cut we just constructed and

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,605
 let's use as an illustration our earlier example of a flow network.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:11,780
 Here's our example of a flow network G with the capacities marked in red.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,045
 We're looking at a flow f star which has no ST path

5
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:18,720
 in the residual network G superscript f star.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,940
 Here's an example of such a flow f star with the green numbers indicating the flow.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,827
 Now let's look at this residual network for this flow f star.

8
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,055
 Recall some properties of this residual network.

9
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,850
 For example, this edge from E to D has

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,790
 positive flow so the reverse edge from D to E appears in this graph.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,340
 Also the edge from E to D has some spare capacity

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,070
 available so the edge from E to D itself appears there.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,910
 Similarly, this edge from D to C has some flow

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,995
 along it so the reverse edge from C to D appears.

15
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:54,300
 But the edge from D to C has no leftover capacity

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,160
 available so the forward edge does not appear in this residual network.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,510
 Now the capacities on these edges in the residual network are not important.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,825
 What's important are simply which edges are present or not.

19
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:07,500
 We define this set L, to be the set of vertices

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,070
 reachable from the source vertex in this residual network.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,445
 Let's look at the set L in this example.

22
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:16,160
 So certainly s itself is reachable from S,

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,360
 also B is reachable and then we reach E and D and A.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,810
 So these five vertices are the set L and

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,715
 the remaining three vertices are the set R and that defines our ST cut LR.

26
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:36,225
 By assumption, T is not reachable from S in this residual network therefore T is an R,

27
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:38,195
 so it's a valid ST cut.

28
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:41,325
 Let's look at some properties of this ST cut LR.

29
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:45,120
 For convenience let me draw this L on the original graph as well.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,290
 Let's look at edges in the original graph which go from the set L outside to R,

31
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,670
 D to T is one such example,

32
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,335
 D to C is another example and S to C is another example.

33
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:01,260
 Now notice that none of these edges appear in the residual network.

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,135
 Why? Because L is the set of vertices reachable from S

35
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:09,480
 so this edge from D to T appeared in this residual network,

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,370
 then T would be added into the set L. It would be reachable from S and

37
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,320
 then we'd have a contradiction with the definition of

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,095
 L. So for any edge in the original graph,

39
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:21,045
 say from V to W,

40
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:23,325
 if this edge leaves the set L,

41
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,700
 so V is in L and W is in R,

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,200
 well we know that this edge does not appear in

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,950
 the residual network so what does that say about the flow along this edge?

44
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,570
 This edge must be fully capacitated and therefore the forward edge does

45
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,530
 not appear in the residual network so the flow along this edge equals its capacity.

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,675
 Now since every edge from L to R is fully capacitated,

47
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:48,585
 what does this say about the total flow out of L?

48
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,960
 Well it's equal to the capacity from L to R.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,330
 The total flow out is equal to the total capacity from L to R. Recall that

50
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,740
 this capacity was defined as edges going from L to R. It doesn't count

51
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,630
 edges going from R to L. Well that's good we're close to what we want to prove.

52
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,950
 Now let's take a look at the edges that are going from R into L in the original graph.

53
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,110
 There is only one such edge in this example,

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,160
 the edge going from F into E. So consider an edge Z to Y in the original graph whereas

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,025
 Z is in R and Y is in this set L.

56
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:26,220
 What do we know about the flow along this edge from Z to Y,

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,180
 say from F to E?

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,300
 What's flow zero, why?

59
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,355
 Because this edge from E to F,

60
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:36,095
 the reverse edge does not appear in this residual network.

61
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:39,465
 If it did appear then F would be included in the set L

62
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:43,905
 which it's not so since the back edge does not appear in the residual network,

63
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:46,715
 then this forward edge has to have flow zero.

64
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:49,935
 Since this is true for all edges into the set L,

65
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:55,080
 we conclude that the total flow into L is zero in this flow f star.

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,860
 Now we proved earlier for any flow f star and any ST cut, LR,

67
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,130
 that the size of this flow f star equals the flow out of

68
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,485
 L minus the flow into L. What we've seen so far for this ST cut LR,

69
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:18,270
 the flow out of this set L is equal to the capacity and the flow in equal zero.

70
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,455
 So that means the size of this flow equals the capacity of this cut LR.

71
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:25,380
 This statement is exactly what we need to prove in order to

72
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,380
 finish the proof of the max flow main cut theorem.

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380
 So that completes the proof of the theorem.
