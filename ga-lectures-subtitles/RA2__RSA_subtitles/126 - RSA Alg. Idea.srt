1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,475
 Now we can get to the basic idea behind the RSA algorithm.

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:05,350
 Let's first look at from Fermat's Theorem.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,050
 It talks about a prime number P. Let's look at a pair of numbers, B and C,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,293
 which are relatively prime to each other mod p minus one. Why is P minus one?

5
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:19,473
 Because remember Euler's totient function or Fermat's Little Theorem,

6
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:22,665
 the exponent there is P minus one.

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,810
 Okay? That's where that P minus one comes from.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,840
 So we're taking a pair of numbers B and C which are

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,760
 inverses to each other modulo P minus one. So what does that mean?

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,615
 That means B times C is one mod P minus one,

11
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:40,865
 or in other words B times C is one plus some multiple of P minus one.

12
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,266
 So K is a sum integer.

13
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:46,590
 So that means when we take B times C and we divide

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,580
 it by P minus one then we get a remainder of 1.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,280
 Let's take a number Z between one and P minus one,

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,860
 and let's raise it to the power B times C,

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,680
 and let's take the whole thing mod P. Now we can replace B times C by this formula.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,180
 So we get to Z then we get Z to the K times P minus one.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,305
 We can do the P minus one.

20
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,990
 We can raise the whole thing to the Kth power.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,860
 Now what do we get? Well the Z sticks around.

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,191
 What about the Z to the P minus one? What do we know?

23
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:20,340
 Fermat's Little theorem tells us that Z to the P minus one is congruent to

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,455
 one mod P. So we can replace this by 1 and then one to the K is what?

25
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:29,453
 It's one. So this whole thing is one.

26
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,460
 So it drops out and we're left with Z.

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:39,303
 So Z raised to the power B times C is Z mod P. So we get back Z itself.

28
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:43,130
 Okay? We're starting to get the idea for the encryption and decryption algorithm.

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,500
 I'm going to take a message Z, and now,

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,650
 if I raise it to the power B to encrypt

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,500
 it and then later I raise it to the power C to decrypt it,

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,930
 that's the same as taking Z to

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,171
 the power B times C and that's going to end up with Z itself.

34
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:03,743
 So if I encrypt by raising to power B and then decrypt by raising it to the power C,

35
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:06,170
 I end up with the original message itself.

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,710
 Now, the problem is that I have to tell everybody P,

37
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,731
 so that they can do these operations.

38
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,885
 If I tell them P then they know P minus one, and therefore,

39
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,083
 given B then they can figure out C,

40
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:24,500
 which is the inverse of B with respect to mod P minus 1.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,845
 So I want to conceal this fact.

42
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,250
 I want to conceal this P minus one term.

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,975
 How am I going to do that? Well I'm going to use

44
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,900
 Euler's theorem instead of Fermat's little theorem.

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,970
 For Euler's theorem, I want to have a pair of primes,

46
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,105
 P and Q. I'm going to look at their product N. Now,

47
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,340
 what am I going to do?

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,155
 I'm going to take a pair of numbers, D and E,

49
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:49,825
 which are inverses of each other with respect to P minus one times Q minus one.

50
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:53,291
 So, D times E is congruent to one mod P minus one, Q minus one.

51
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:58,105
 Why did they use P minus one and Q minus one instead of P minus one?

52
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:01,250
 Well, in Fermat's little theorem when I raise Z to the P minus

53
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,185
 one I get one mod P. What happens in Euler's theorem?

54
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,796
 Well, the totient function of N we saw was P minus one,

55
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:12,650
 Q minus one for this case when it's P times Q.

56
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,696
 So if I take a number Z and I raise it to this P minus one Q minus one,

57
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,409
 I'm going to get one,

58
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,485
 when I look at it,

59
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:23,310
 mod N. So, that's what I'm going to do.

60
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,460
 I'm going to take a number Z. I'm going to raise it to

61
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,185
 the power D times E. What do I get?

62
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:31,955
 D times E is congruent to one mod P minus one Q minus one.

63
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:37,430
 That means D times E is equal to one plus some multiple of P minus

64
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,140
 one times Q minus one so I get the one

65
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,350
 and then I get some multiple of P minus one times Q minus one.

66
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,722
 Now what is this,

67
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:48,595
 Z raised to the power P minus one, Q minus one?

68
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,640
 I'm looking at this whole thing mod N. Euler's theorem tells me that

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,100
 if Z is relatively prime to N then this thing is one.

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,860
 So then one raised to the power of K,

71
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,960
 just like before, is one.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,010
 So this term goes away,

73
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,070
 I'm left with Z, and there it is.

74
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,660
 Notice the terms D and E decryption, encryption.

75
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,850
 So, you give me a message Z. I'm going to tell you E and I'm going to tell you N,

76
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,120
 what are you going to do?

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,645
 If you want to send me the message Z,

78
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:21,230
 you're going to take Z and you're going to raise it to power E and then get mod N,

79
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,020
 and then you're going to send it to me.

80
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,000
 That's the encrypted message. What do I do?

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,715
 I compute this D,

82
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:32,320
 which is the inverse of E mod P minus one, Q minus one.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,815
 That's my decryption key.

84
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,370
 So I take that encrypted message with the Z to the E

85
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,035
 mod N. I raise it to the power D. And what am I left with?

86
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,250
 I'm left with Z itself, the original message.

87
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,763
 Now, the point is you know N,

88
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:51,885
 which is P times Q. I know P and Q, but you don't know them.

89
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:53,263
 You just know the product of them,

90
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:55,445
 you know N. So from N,

91
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,880
 can you figure out P minus one times Q minus one?

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,535
 I don't know how to do that unless you tell me P and Q.

93
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,360
 If you just tell me their product P times Q,

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,925
 I don't know how to get P minus one times Q minus out of P times Q.

95
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,300
 But I know P and Q,

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,605
 so I can take P and Q and compute P minus one times Q minus one,

97
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:18,590
 and then I can run extended Euclid algorithm to compute

98
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,350
 the inverse of E mod P minus one, Q minus one.

99
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,040
 So I can compute D but nobody else knows how to

100
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,250
 compute D because they don't know P minus one, Q minus one.

101
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,421
 They simply know N, P times Q.

102
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,615
 So, everybody's going to know N,

103
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,420
 and everybody is going to know E,

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,120
 but I alone know D and that's the decryption key.

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,170
 So I tell everybody E and N,

106
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,663
 we take the message,

107
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:42,836
 raise it to the encrypted power,

108
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,260
 take it mod N, that's the encrypted message.

109
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,090
 Send that. The whole world can see that,

110
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,740
 but only I can decrypt it.

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:48,740
 So now let's go ahead and detail the RSA algorithm.
