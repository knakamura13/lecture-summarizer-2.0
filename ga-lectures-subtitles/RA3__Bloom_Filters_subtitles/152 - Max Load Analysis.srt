1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,451
 Now we want to bound the probability that the max load is at least log n,

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:05,260
 that's the quantity here.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,845
 In order for the maximum load to be at least log n,

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,148
 at least one bin, maybe several,

5
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:14,384
 have to have a load at least log n. In order to upper bound this probability,

6
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:16,230
 we can use our earlier analysis.

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,345
 We know the probability that a particular bin gets loaded,

8
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:21,945
 at least log n, is at most one over N squared.

9
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:25,660
 So now, in order for at least one bin to get loaded at least log n,

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,320
 lets look at all the choices for the bins.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,930
 So we can sum over each bin,

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,620
 and then we can look at the probability that the load in bin BI,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,375
 is at least log n,

14
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,256
 which is what we bounded right here.

15
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:40,000
 That's at most 1 over N squared.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,120
 There are N choices for the bin,

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,180
 and for each particular bin the probability the load

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,148
 is at least log n is at most 1 over N squared,

19
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,300
 and this is, 1 over N,

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,440
 which proves the result,

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,905
 that the max load is at least log n,

22
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,250
 with probability at most 1 over N.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,755
 Now, we want to look at the complementary event,

24
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:03,665
 that the max load is strictly less than log n. What is the probability of this?

25
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:05,910
 Well, this event is unlikely to happen.

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,690
 This happens with a small probability,

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,780
 this is going to happen with a large probability.

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,050
 In particular, it happens with probability at least one minus one over N. And in fact,

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,670
 one can do a similar analysis,

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,915
 a little bit more carefully,

31
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:21,925
 and you can show that the max load is theta

32
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:25,470
 of log n over log log n. So we can get an upper bound,

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,350
 and a lower bound which are within constants of each other.

34
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,995
 So, instead of an upper bound of log n, on the max load,

35
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:36,240
 we can get a slightly better bound of log n over log log n. And

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,060
 this error probability can be boosted from one over

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,255
 N to 1 over and squared or 1 over N to the tenth,

38
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:43,980
 any polynomial, and then,

39
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,875
 we can get here by changing the constant up front.

40
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,295
 And when this error probability is 1 over a polynomial and N,

41
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:53,535
 we say that this event happens with high probability.

42
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:56,595
 In particular, if it happens with high probability,

43
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:59,100
 then that means it happens with probability at least one

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,920
 minus one over some polynomial and N,

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,315
 and we can make this polynomial small as we want,

46
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:04,315
 by increasing this constant up front.
