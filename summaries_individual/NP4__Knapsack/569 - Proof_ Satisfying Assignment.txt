Solving specific subset sum instances equates to satisfying assignments for Boolean variables \(X_1\) to \(X_n\) in an input formula \(f\). The first n digits in these instances indicate true/false for \(X_1\) to \(X_n\), and subsequent digits are tied to clauses \(C_j\). A digit 3 in position \(n+j\) indicates clause \(C_j\) must be satisfied by including at least one corresponding number from literals in \(C_j\). Various scenarios: satisfying one literal uses two buffer numbers (\(S_j\) and \(S_j'\)) to sum to 3, two literals require one buffer number, and three satisfied literals need no buffer, automatically summing to 3. No satisfied literals mean no sum of 3, thus no solution. Hence, a solution to the subset sums assures satisfaction of all clauses, providing a satisfying \(f\) assignment. Moreover, satisfying a 3SAT formula guarantees a corresponding solution to the subset sum, confirming a bidirectional implication between the two problem instances.
