In our linear algebraic approach to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we define a vector "a", a resultant vector "A", and a matrix "M" with subscript "n" indicating its dependency on the size and the nth root of unity "omega sub n". The FFT operation is represented as A = Mn * a, where Mn contains powers of "omega sub n". Conversely, the Inverse FFT (IFFT) aims to find vector "a" from vector "A" by employing the inverse of matrix "Mn". This process involves calculating the product of the inverse of Mn and vector A. The matrices for FFT and IFFT resemble each other with the relationship between "Mn" and its inverse being a key aspect of transitioning between the time and frequency domains.
