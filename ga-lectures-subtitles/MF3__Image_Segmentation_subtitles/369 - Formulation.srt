00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
 We are going to view the images lying on a graph with the vertices of a graph correspond

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,580
 to the pixels of the image.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,575
 So let us look at an example of a pixelated image.

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,920
 Here is an example of a small pixelated image magnified.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,730
 The input is going to be specified by an undirected graph

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,520
 G. The vertices of the graph once again correspond to the pixels of the image.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,910
 So there are nine vertices in

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,910
 this example and the edges will go between neighboring pixels.
