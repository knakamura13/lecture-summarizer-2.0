In the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, vertex levels in the residual network are examined, focusing on vertex Z. As the algorithm progresses and the residual network evolves with edge deletions and additions, it is shown that vertex levels can only stay the same or increase, never decrease. For example, if an edge from A to D is removed, the level of D increases because the shortest path from source S to D gets longer. Conversely, adding edges, such as from B to D, might intuitively seem to reduce D's level, but thatâ€™s not the case. The proof lies in understanding the modifications within the residual network, particularly which edges get added or removed, supporting the claim about non-decreasing levels of vertices.
