Examining inverses of integers 1-13 mod 14. Modulo inv has distinct rules, the key is common divisors with the modulus, N=14. 1 and 13 are self-inverse (1 x 1 & 13 x 13 ≡ 1 mod 14). No inverse for numbers sharing divisors with 14 (2, 4, 6, 7, 8). Inverses exist for numbers coprime to 14; e.g., 3's inverse is 5 (since 3 x 5 ≡ 1 mod 14), 5's inverse is 3, and 9's inverse is 11 (9 x 11 ≡ 1 mod 14). Pattern: Inverses exist if no common divisor with N=14, i.e., they're relatively prime.
