1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
 Now just to summarize we let capital L be the sum of

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,600
 the foreground and background likelihoods for all pixels.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,820
 Now for a partition F,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,440
 B we define its weight to be

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,790
 the following quantity: it's a sum over the vertices assigned to the foreground of

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,960
 their foreground likelihood plus the pixels assigned to the background of

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,760
 their background likelihood minus the separation penalty for separated edges.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,355
 Now let's define a new weight W prime.

9
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:31,060
 This is the sum over vertices assigned to the foreground of their background likelihood

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,825
 plus the sum over vertices assigned to the background of their foreground likelihood.

11
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,675
 And now we'll add instead of subtract

12
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,240
 the separation penalty and the key point

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,130
 is that these two quantities are related in the following manner,

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,561
 W_F,B equals L minus W'_F, B.

15
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:54,690
 The separation penalty's cancel from both sides and then when you add up

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,163
 these remaining terms you get L. Now the point is if we find the partition F,

17
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:03,750
 B which maximizes the weight W of F,

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,957
 B this is equivalent to finding the partition F,

19
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:10,015
 B which minimizes W'.

20
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,360
 Since we're subtracting off W'

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,450
 minimizing this term is the same as maximizing the whole quantity.

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,690
 So we've changed our maximization problem into

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,635
 a minimization problem and all the terms and W prime are positive.

24
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:28,115
 So now this is in potential form that we can convert it to a mean SD cut problem.

25
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,072
 And how do we solve the mean SD card problem?

26
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:32,510
 We solve it by doing the max flow problem.

27
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,155
 So we're going to find a flow networks,

28
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:36,555
 solve the max flow on that flow network

29
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:36,555
 and then that will give us the mean SD cut solution.
