1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,225
 Now, we just saw that the MST problem is an NP.

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:06,420
 So, we've seen that MST is a search problem.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,200
 Now, let's prove that MST is in P. And to

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,970
 show that the MST problem is in P, there's two parts.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,350
 First, we have to show that the MST problem is a search problem.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,385
 Well, that's what we just did to show that MST is an NP.

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,870
 So we've done that first part.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,670
 The second part is to show that we can find a solution in polynomial time.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,890
 How do we find a solution in polynomial time?

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,270
 We simply use Kruskal or Prim's algorithm.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,820
 This shows the second part.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:29,820
 So this completes the proof that MST is NP.
