In this lecture, we're going to have two main tasks. The first task, is to prove the max-flow min-cut theorem. Later, we're going to use this theorem to solve the image segmentation problem. Our second main task, is to prove correctness of the Ford Fulkerson algorithm. And in fact we will prove correctness of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm at the same time. Now this is going to follow as a byproduct of the max-flow min-cut theorem. Let's start with a quick overview of what we've seen so far for the Ford Fulkerson algorithm.
