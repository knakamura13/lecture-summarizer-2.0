In linear programming, established that a specific primal-dual LP pair had matched optimal objective function values (both 2400) at feasible points X (200, 200, 100) in the primal and Y in the dual. This demonstration is backed by the weak duality theorem which implies that if a feasible X in the primal and feasible Y in the dual have equal objective function values (C transpose X equals B transpose Y), then both are optimal; X is the primal maximum and Y is the dual minimum. Furthermore, the strong duality theorem guarantees the existence of such optimal primal-dual pairs assuming both LPs are feasible and bounded. Cases with infeasibility or unbounded solutions in either LP require separate consideration.
