Considering an optimal point (Y-star, Z-star) for an ILP, with the objective function value at this point being M-star â€“ the maximum number of satisfiable clauses in formula F. Noting that solving the ILP directly is not feasible in polynomial time, the approach shifts to transforming the ILP into a similar linear program (LP) by relaxing integer constraints. This LP can be solved in polynomial time yielding a solution (Y-hat-star, Z-hat-star), which will always be equal to or better than the ILP's solution due to the LP having a larger feasible set. The LP's solution provides an upper bound on M-star, but doesn't directly find it. To bridge the gap between LP and ILP, the LP solution is converted into a feasible ILP solution by probabilistically rounding fractional values to integers. This creates a valid boolean assignment for F, which is proven to be close in quality to the LP solution. This method ensures the new integer solution isn't significantly worse than the optimal ILP solution, thus providing a near-optimal solution within polynomial time constraints.
