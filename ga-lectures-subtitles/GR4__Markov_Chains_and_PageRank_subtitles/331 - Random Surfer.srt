1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,735
 So let's formalize this notion of doing a random walk on the web graph,

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,145
 where occasionally we hit the random button.

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:07,680
 And by hitting the random button,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,995
 we're going to go to a random web page.

5
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:12,505
 So we're going to have an additional parameter Alpha

6
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:16,355
 and this Alpha is going to be the probability that we hit the random button.

7
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:20,340
 Actually, to be consistent with the actual PageRank definition,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,125
 Alphas can be a complement of that event.

9
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,780
 So with probability one minus Alpha,

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,410
 we're going to hit the random button and go to a random web page in the graph.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,985
 And with probably Alpha,

12
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:32,775
 we're going to follow a random edge out of the current web page.

13
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,630
 So this parameter Alpha is called the damping parameter.

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,690
 It's strictly greater than zero and it's at most one.

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,505
 Why is it called the damping parameter?

16
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:45,835
 Because what we're doing is we're scaling down this original webgraph by a factor Alpha.

17
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:49,070
 So we're scaling down the webgraph by a factor Alpha and then we're

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,320
 adding in a complete graph of weight one minus Alpha.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,090
 So now let's look at our random walk.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,880
 Let's say we're currently at a web page Y.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,870
 Then with probability Alpha,

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,240
 we're going to follow a random outgoing link from Y.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,630
 So if Alpha equals one,

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,890
 this is exactly the same as our original random walk.

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,694
 So we're not using this random button at all,

26
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,435
 because one minus Alpha is zero.

27
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:14,050
 But when Alpha is strictly less than

28
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,050
 one then we're going to use the random button sometimes.

29
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,850
 So with probability one minus Alpha,

30
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,555
 we're going to go to a random page.

31
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:25,145
 This destination page is chosen uniformly at random from all web pages.

32
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:26,935
 So this is our random surfer model.

33
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:31,490
 So you give me a parameter Alpha and then my random walk looks like the following.

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,134
 I'm currently at a web page Y, with probability Alpha.

35
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:37,755
 I'll look at all the outgoing links from Y

36
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:40,240
 and I'll choose one of those uniformly at random.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,435
 And with probability one minus Alpha,

38
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,765
 I'm going to go to a random web page uniformly at random from all web pages in the graph.

39
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,220
 So I'm at this web page Y,

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,520
 I flip a coin or I choose a random number uniformly at random between zero and one.

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,792
 If this random number is at most Alpha,

42
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:00,815
 then I choose a random outgoing link.

43
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:04,230
 If this random number is strictly greater than Alpha ,

44
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,205
 then I go to a random web page uniformly at random from all web pages.

45
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,930
 Now what Alpha should we choose?

46
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,699
 Well according to Wikipedia,

47
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:13,699
 Google apparently chooses an Alpha which is at roughly 0.85.
