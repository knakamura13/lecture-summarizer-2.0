A stationary distribution pi for a Markov chain with transition matrix P satisfies piP = pi, indicating that the Markov chain remains in the same distribution after a step if it starts in pi. For a Markov chain with N states, the existence and uniqueness of such a stationary distribution are in question. All states ultimately reach the stationary distribution in the 62-10 example, highlighting a unique stationary distribution. The inquiry extends to whether this convergence is universal, and when unique, how swiftly the stationarity is achieved, termed as the mixing timeâ€”a focus of my research, although not discussed here. Furthermore, to guarantee a unique stationary distribution, understanding properties that lead to multiple stationary distributions is insightful, as it suggests opposing conditions that may ensure uniqueness and consistent convergence from any starting point.
