Key idea: Developed an algorithm for solving 2SAT problems based on unproven but utilized property that conflicting variables (Xi and Xi bar) belong to separate strongly connected components (SCCs) in the implication graph. Algorithm steps: 1. Simplify input formula f by eliminating unit clauses, ensuring all remaining clauses have size 2. 2. Construct a graph of implications based on f. 3. Run SCC algorithm on the implication graph G, ordering SCCs topologically. 4. Set the last (sink) SCC to 'true', their logical opposites (source SCC) to 'false'. 5. Remove the satisfied sink SCC and its complement source SCC from G. 6. Repeat the process, setting truth values and removing SCCs, till G is empty and f is satisfied. Performance: Main computational effort lies in constructing SCCs, which is linear time. Overall algorithm runs in time proportional to the sum of vertices and edges (O(n+m)). Proof needed: The algorithm's validity hinges on the yet-to-be-demonstrated assumption that every sink and its complementary source SCC can be assigned opposite truth values without conflict.
