If xi and xi bar (the positive and negative literals) are in the same strongly connected component (SCC) of a graph, then the formula cannot be satisfied due to inevitable contradictions arising from any assignment of truth values. Contrarily, if each xi and xi bar pair is in separate SCCs, the formula is satisfiable. This condition will be demonstrated by constructing an algorithm designed to find a satisfying assignment for the formula, effectively proving a formula's satisfiability when its literals are appropriately divided among different SCCs.
