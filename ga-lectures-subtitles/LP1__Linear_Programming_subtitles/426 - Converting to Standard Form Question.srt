1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,434
 Now how can we convert an arbitrary linear program into this standard form?

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:06,389
 For instance, suppose that we want to minimize

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,599
 this linear function instead of maximize this linear function,

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,800
 where we simply multiply this whole thing by negative one.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,210
 And this is equivalent to maximizing negative C times X.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,370
 So, we can replace this vector C by

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,164
 negative C and then we can maximize and it's equivalent to LP.

8
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:28,440
 Now, what if we have a constraint that says A1X1 through AnXn is at least B,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,065
 instead of at most B.

10
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,600
 Once again we can multiply this by negative one.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:41,460
 And this is equivalent to -A1 times X1 through An times Xn is at most negative B.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,409
 Now, what if we have an equality constraint?

13
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,042
 So we want to set it equal to B,

14
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:48,659
 where we can replace this by two inequality constraints.

15
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:55,304
 We can say that A1X1 through AnXn is at most B and at least B.

16
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:58,384
 And the second of these at least B constraint.

17
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:04,400
 We can replace in this manner by an inequality at most negative B.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,484
 Now, what if we have a strict inequality?

19
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,420
 So we say that X is strictly less than 100.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,390
 How do we convert this into a non-strict inequality?

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,060
 Well, suppose the LP just said maximize

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,170
 X subject to the constraint that X is strictly less than 100.

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,655
 What's the solution, what's the optimal value of this function, this linear program?

24
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,599
 Well, it's not clear what the optimal is.

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,825
 So this ill defined linear program.

26
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:31,459
 So strict inequalities are not allowed in linear programming.

27
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,799
 Now, geometrically the way to view these strict inequalities.

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,364
 Well, first off look at these non-strict inequalities.

29
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:43,269
 In this case the feasible region corresponds to this closed convex polyhedron.

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:48,269
 So the optimal points will lie on the boundary of this polyhedron.

31
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,250
 But if we have strict inequalities,

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,319
 then the points on the boundary of the polyhedron do not lie in the feasible region.

33
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,829
 So it's an open set.

34
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,015
 And the problem is ill defined because we don't know what the optimal is.

35
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,430
 So strict inequalities are not allowed.

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,579
 Finally, what do we do if we have an unconstrained variable X?

37
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,199
 So X can be positive or negative.

38
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,455
 We don't have this non-negativity constraint.

39
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:13,025
 How do we add in this non-negativity constraint?

40
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,580
 Well, we create two new variables,

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,560
 the positive magnitude of X and the negative magnitude of X,

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,689
 X plus and X minus.

43
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,300
 We constrain X plus to be non-negative and X minus to be non-negative.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,240
 So these corresponds to the magnitudes and we replace X by X plus minus X minus.

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 And in this manner we can consider all variables to be non-negative.
