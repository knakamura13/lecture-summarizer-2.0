1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,545
 Now, let's prove the main claim that we made earlier.

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,215
 For every vertex Z,

3
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:06,180
 the level of that vertex does not

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,940
 decrease during the course of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
 Now, the residual graph may change.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,755
 We may add edges or delete edges from the residual graph,

7
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:17,160
 but the level of the vertex never decreases.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,935
 How potentially can the level of a vertex decrease?

9
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,280
 While the level of a vertex might decrease if we add an edge

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,160
 from Y to Z and Y gives a shorter path to Z.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,700
 Now, suddenly removing edges can decrease

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,665
 the level of a vertex so we can ignore removing edges.

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,970
 We simply have to look at adding edges and their potential effect.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,390
 So suppose the level of Vertex Z is currently I and then

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,740
 suppose that we add this edge from Y to Z into the residual network.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,845
 Now, if we add this edge from Y to Z to the residual network, what do we know?

17
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,140
 Well, as we just saw,

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,890
 then the reverse direction edge must be on the augmenting path.

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,220
 Now, we have to utilize the properties of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,140
 Edmonds-Karp algorithm says this path,

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,660
 this augmenting path is a BFS path.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,895
 So we obtained this path by running BFS.

23
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:06,255
 Now what do we know about pass from BFS?

24
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,010
 We know that on this path,

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,905
 the level of the vertices increases by Plus 1 along every edge.

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:16,105
 Therefore, the level of Y must be the level of Z plus 1.

27
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:21,195
 We said the level of Z is i so therefore the level of Y is I plus 1.

28
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,850
 So we added this edge from Y to Z but

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,045
 this edge goes from a higher level to a lower level.

30
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,460
 So it certainly does not decrease the level of vertex Z.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,555
 It does not give a shorter path to Z.

32
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:36,680
 So the level of the vertex Z does not decrease when we add this edge in.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,790
 Now, this completes the proof of this claim.

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,010
 So we prove that the level of a vertex never

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,705
 decreases during the course of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

36
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,835
 This completes the proof of the claim but

37
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:47,970
 in order to bound the number of rounds of the algorithm,

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,710
 we're going to have to prove something stronger.

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,585
 We're going to have to prove that occasionally,

40
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:55,590
 the level of a vertex strictly increases and

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,590
 then this will give us a bound on the number of rounds of the algorithm.
