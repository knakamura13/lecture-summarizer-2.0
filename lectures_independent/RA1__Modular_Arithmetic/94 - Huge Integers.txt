Lets look at the context of the RSA algorithm. In cryptography, we're going to work with N-bit numbers X, Y and N. For example, the number of bits in these numbers is going to be huge. Think of the number of bits as 1024 or 2048. It's a huge number of bits. So normally, we thought of our arithmetic operations as built into hardware, but that usually restricts the attention to 64 bits or so. But here we're talking about 1000 or 2000 bits. So we have to go back and review how long does it take for basic arithmetic operations.
