00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
 In this section we're going to study computational complexity.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,275
 We're going to address the following question.

3
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:07,380
 What precisely does NP completeness

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,420
 mean and how do we prove that a problem is NP complete.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,955
 Many of you have probably heard of the equation P equals NP or P naught equals NP.

6
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,940
 We're going to take a look at what precisely this question means.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
 Finally we're going to look at how do we show that a particular problem is intractable.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,285
 Now what exactly do we mean by intractable,

9
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:27,260
 we mean that is unlikely to be solved efficiently.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,570
 Now we'd love to say that it definitely cannot be solved efficiently,

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,985
 instead of unlikely to be solved efficiently.

12
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,460
 But that's more than we can achieve at this time.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,990
 Now what exactly do we mean by efficiently.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,610
 Well, by that we mean that is polynomial in the input size.

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,350
 Can we solve this particular problem,

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,015
 in time polynomial in the input size.

17
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:48,765
 Now in order to show that a particular problem is intractable,

18
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,730
 what we're going to do is, we're going to prove that it's NP complete.

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,540
 So we're going to learn how to prove that a particular problem is NP complete.

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:55,540
 So let's dive in now to see what P and NP mean.
