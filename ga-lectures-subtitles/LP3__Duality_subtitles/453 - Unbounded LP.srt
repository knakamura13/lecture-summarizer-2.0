1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,795
 Now let's take a look at another corollary,

2
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:03,280
 the weak duality theorem.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,010
 Here's the second corollary.

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,115
 Suppose the primal LP is unbounded so the left hand side here will be infinite.

5
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:12,015
 What does that imply about the dual LP?

6
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:14,537
 Well, the right hand side has to be bigger than infinite.

7
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,200
 There's no way to achieve that.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,155
 So the dual LP must be infeasible.

9
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:21,300
 So if the primal is unbounded,

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,780
 then the dual LP is infeasible and vice versa.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,340
 If the dual is unbounded,

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,125
 then the primal is infeasible because the dual LP is minimizing the right hand side.

13
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,925
 So if that's negative infinity,

14
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,480
 then this is undefined.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,350
 So the primal must be infeasible.

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,880
 Now notice this is not an equivalence.

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,925
 This is not an if and only if statement.

18
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:46,830
 It can be the case that the primal is infeasible and the dual is infeasible.

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,120
 So the implication has only one direction.

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,045
 If we know that the dual is infeasible,

21
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:55,950
 then the primal LP might be unbounded or it might be infeasible.

22
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,880
 And you'll do as a homework exercise to construct an example where the

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,935
 primal is infeasible and the dual is also infeasible.

24
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:06,085
 But now this implication is important.

25
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,730
 It says that if the primal LP is unbounded,

26
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:08,730
 then the dual is infeasible. Now let's use that.
