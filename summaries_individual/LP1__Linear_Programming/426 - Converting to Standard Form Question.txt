Converting an arbitrary linear program (LP) to standard form includes several transformations: to minimize a linear function, multiply it by -1 to maximize -C*X, equivalently. Change constraints A1 through An from ≥B to ≤-B by also multiplying by -1. For equality constraints set to B, split into two inequalities, ≤B and ≥B, with the latter becoming ≤-B after negation. Strict inequalities (e.g., X<100) aren't allowed as they yield ill-defined LPs with optimal points indeterminate, since they imply an open feasible region rather than a closed convex polyhedron. To handle unconstrained variables, split them into their positive (X+) and negative (X-) components, both non-negative, replacing X with X+ minus X-. All variables can thus be treated as non-negative.
