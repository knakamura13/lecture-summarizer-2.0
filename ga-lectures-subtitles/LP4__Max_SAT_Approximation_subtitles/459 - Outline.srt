1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,255
 And we're going to start by looking at a very simple randomized algorithm,

2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:05,670
 and we'll show that this simple algorithm achieves

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,320
 a one-half approximation algorithm for Max-SAT.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,090
 After that, we're going to look at an LP-based algorithm and we're going to prove that

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,000
 this new LP-based algorithm achieves a 1-1_over_E approximation factor,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,130
 so to improve the previous algorithm by a little bit.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,780
 Finally, we're going to look at an algorithm which is

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,760
 a combination of these two algorithms,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,950
 and this combined algorithm is going to achieve a three-quarters approximation.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:27,950
 So let's dive into the simple scheme.
