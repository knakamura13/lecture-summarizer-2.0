Practicing dual LP formulation. Original LP: Maximize 5x1 - 7x2 + 2x3 subject to x1 + x2 - 4x3 ≤ 1, 2x1 - x2 ≥ 3, with x1, x2, x3 ≥ 0. To determine dual LP, need to identify the number of variables and constraints. Dual LP will have variables corresponding to the primal constraints and constraints corresponding to the primal variables. The primal LP has two constraints, so the dual will have two variables. Since the primal LP has three variables, the dual will have three constraints, excluding non-negativity constraints. Next, the specifics of dual LP formulation will be addressed, including the objective and constraint functions.
