Transformed input SAT formula into 3SAT formula, denoted as f prime. Proved f is satisfiable iff f prime is satisfiable. If 3SAT algorithm finds f prime unsatisfiable, then f is unsatisfiable. If it finds a satisfying assignment for f prime, ignore new variable assignments and retain original ones for a satisfying assignment for f, completing the reduction. F prime, in the worst case, has nm variables and nm clauses due to a potential n new variables and n new clauses per original clause, yet the size of f prime is still polynomially related to f. Therefore, the a algorithm's polynomial running time holds relative to the size of both f and f prime, concluding the NP-completeness proof.
