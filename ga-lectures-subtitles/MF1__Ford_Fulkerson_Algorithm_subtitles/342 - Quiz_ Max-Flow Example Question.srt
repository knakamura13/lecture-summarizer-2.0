00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
 To make sure you understand the formulation of the max-flow problem,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,240
 let's take a look back at our earlier example.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,590
 So here's a flow network with a specified start and end vertex,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,915
 and we specified the capacity for every edge.

5
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:15,790
 Now specify a flow.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,410
 So for specify the flow along every edge where

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,820
 this flow is of maximum size and the flow needs to be valid,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,235
 so it needs to satisfy the two constraints,

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:30,300
 which are the capacity constraints along every edge and

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,300
 the conservation of flow along every vertex except for S and T.
