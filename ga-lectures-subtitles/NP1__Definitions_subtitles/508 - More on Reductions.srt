00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,195
 To reduce colorings to SAT, what do we need to show?

2
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:05,310
 We need to find these two functions,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,860
 f and h. f takes an input for

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,658
 the colorings problem and produces an input for the SAT problem.

5
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:15,944
 If you think of the input for the colorings problem as a graph and a number of colors,

6
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:17,430
 so it's a G and a k,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,705
 then there are input for the SAT problem is f of Gk.

8
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:27,275
 Now, h takes a solution to this SAT problem o this f of Gk is a Boolean formula.

9
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,680
 It's going to take an assignment,

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,950
 a satisfying assignment for this boolean formula and it's going to

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,805
 produce a solution to the original colorings problem on Gk.

12
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,650
 So it's going to take an assignment which

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,200
 satisfies this boolean formula and it's going to

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,995
 produce h of S which is a colorings for this graph using k colors.

15
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:48,160
 We need to define these two functions f,

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,270
 which transforms inputs to colorings to inputs to SAT and h,

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,970
 which transform solutions to SAT into solutions for two colorings.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,585
 Now, what do we need to prove in order to prove that this reduction is valid.

19
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:01,725
 Well, we need to prove that,

20
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,380
 if S was a solution to f,

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,350
 then h of S is a solution to the original

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,175
 G. But we also need that if there was no solution to f,

23
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:13,880
 then there is no solution to the colorings problem.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,770
 So we need to show that if S was a solution to this SAT input,

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:23,003
 then h of S is a solution to this colorings input and vice versa.

26
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:24,540
 We need to show this equivalence,

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,320
 this if and only if statement because we need to know that the solutions

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,870
 here map to solutions here and no instances here are mapped to no instance here.

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,420
 We need both directions.

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,420
 We need solutions here if and only if solutions here.
