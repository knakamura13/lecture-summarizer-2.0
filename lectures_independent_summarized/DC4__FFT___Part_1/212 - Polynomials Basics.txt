Polynomials A(x) can be represented by coefficients or by their values at n distinct points, with it being unique for each representation. While coefficients are a natural representation, values ease polynomial multiplication. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm facilitates conversion between coefficients and values, optimizing the points chosen for evaluation to leverage this conversion. Specifically, FFT is used to change coefficients to values for multiplication, then back to coefficients post-multiplication, benefiting from the efficiency in multiplying polynomials in the values representation. The selection of points for the FFT is a critical aspect of its efficiency and elegance.
