Define the min st-cut problem in directed graphs: identify a cut (L,R) minimizing the sum of edge capacities from L to R. L includes start vertex s, R includes end vertex t. Example provided where L contains s, a, b, f with a cut capacity of 27. Presented an optimal st-cut with capacity 12, where R contains only t and L contains all other vertices. Max-flow-min-cut theorem links max flow size to min st-cut size, validating optimality of the demonstrated st-cut with a corresponding flow of 12.
