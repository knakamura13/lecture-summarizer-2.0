Kruskal's algorithm correctness hinges on the cut property, which asserts any minimum weight edge crossing a cut (partition) is part of at least one minimum spanning tree (MST). When edge e* (minimum weight edge) connects vertices v and w in different components (partitions without a common path), it satisfies the lemma underlying the cut property. This ensures that e* can be added to the growing MST without increasing its total weight, advancing towards an MST. If an existing MST doesn't include e*, one can insert e* and potentially remove another edge to form a new MST, T', with weight less than or equal to the original. This principle confirms that continually adding such minimum crossing edges, as Kruskal's algorithm does, results in an MST. This proof of concept is pivotal to understanding Kruskal's method and reinforces the validity of the cut property for any set S.
