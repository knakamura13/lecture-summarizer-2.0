1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
 So we've got a web page X.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,745
 We're going to look at the In neighbors.

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:08,095
 So these are the web pages Y which have a link to X.

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,030
 So we're going to sum over these.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,190
 The old scheme just counted the number of these In neighbors.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,012
 So the old scheme you can view it as a sum over the in

7
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:20,770
 neighbors and we get plus one for each in neighbor.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,335
 In the new scheme, we want to scale it by number of

9
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,795
 outgoing links from each of these web pages.

10
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,590
 So if Y1 has a lot of outgoing links, let's say it has 1000,

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,860
 then this link is going to give us one over 1000.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,980
 And if this web page has only one link to X,

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,120
 then this one gives us one.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,765
 And in general, from a web page Y,

15
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:45,170
 we're going to get one over the number of out links from Y.

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,170
 And we're going to sum this up over the Ys which have a link to X.
