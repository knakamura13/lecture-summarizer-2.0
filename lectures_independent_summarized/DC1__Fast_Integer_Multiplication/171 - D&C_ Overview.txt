Divide and conquer techniques expounded with RSA algorithm examples: fast modular exponentiation and Euclid's GCD. Exploring n-bit integer multiplication vital for large integers in RSA, where standard hardware operations are insufficient. Traditional multiplication takes n^2 time; aim for a faster algorithm. Also covering linear-time median calculation and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Assumed prior knowledge includes merge sort and solving recurrences, with textbook resources for refreshment. Next focus: efficient n-bit integer multiplication.
