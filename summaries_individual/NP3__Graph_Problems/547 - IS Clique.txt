Demonstrated reduction from independent set problem to clique problem, utilizing graph G and goal g. Reduction involves using G's complement G bar and g as inputs for the clique problem. A solution S to the clique problem in G bar signifies S is an independent set in G. Consequently, verifying that the clique problem remains NP-complete hinges on this reasoning. If no clique of size g exists in G bar, there's no independent set of size g in G. The correctness of this reduction is confirmed through these observations, hence establishing the NP-completeness of the clique problem.
