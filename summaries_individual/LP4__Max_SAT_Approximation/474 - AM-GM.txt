Examining the relationship between arithmetic and geometric means for K non-negative weights (W1-WK). Arithmetic mean is the sum of weights divided by K, geometric mean is the Kth root of the weights' product. Arithmetic mean >= geometric mean. Applied this to one minus Yi star hat (presumably from a data set), with arithmetic mean of these values >= geometric mean. Taking the Kth power of both, an inequality is established for further use.
