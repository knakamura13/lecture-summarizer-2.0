00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
 Before we give the statement of the cut property,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,045
 let's do a little bit of terminology.

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,740
 Here again is our running example of a graph.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,625
 In general, we have an undirected graph,

5
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:14,010
 G and a cut of the graph is a set of edges which partition the vertices into two sets,

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,835
 S and the complement of S. So for a particular set S,

7
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:23,805
 the cut edges are those edges with one endpoint in S and the other endpoint in S bar.

8
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,010
 In words, what are the cut edges?

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,560
 The cut edges are the edges crossing between S and S bar.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,395
 Let's take a look at a particular cut in this graph.

11
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:36,810
 So I partitioned it into S and S bar.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,460
 Now what are the cut edges?

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,065
 The cut edges are the five edges which are crossing between S and S bar.

14
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:45,425
 These five edges are the cut S, S bar.

15
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:49,460
 Later in the course, we're going to look at various optimization problems involving cuts.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,405
 We're going to try to find a minimum cut.

17
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,690
 So the fewest number of edges in order

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,930
 to disconnect the graph into at least two components.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,233
 And we're also going to look at the max cut problem

20
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,440
 where we're trying to find the cut of largest size.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,415
 But for now we're just looking at the general notion of what is a cut.

22
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:09,035
 So to summarize, if I give you a set S and S bar,

23
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:09,035
 then the cut S, S bar is a set of edges crossing between S and S bar.
