00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,525
 This is a short refresher lecture on Solving Recurrences.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,730
 We're going to focus on the type of recurrences

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,275
 that arise in divide and conquer algorithms.

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:12,195
 A classical recurrence is that for merge sort T of N equals

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,105
 two times T of N over two plus Order N. To sort N numbers,

6
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:21,045
 we partition the list into the first N over two numbers and the last N over two numbers.

7
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:25,135
 We recursively sort those two sub lists, that takes time,

8
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:28,107
 two times T of N over two and then it takes as

9
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:31,575
 Order N Time to merge these two sorted list together.

10
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,985
 As you probably know, this recurrence solves to order logN.

11
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,930
 Let's look at some other recurrences that we've seen

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,155
 so far in divide and conquer examples.

13
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:42,815
 The naive algorithm for integer multiplication had the following recurrence,

14
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:45,915
 T of N equals four times T of N over two

15
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:49,845
 plus order N. And we claim that this solves the Order N Square.

16
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,430
 We'll see you why momentarily.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,760
 Our improved algorithm for integer multiplication had

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,525
 three sub problems instead of four sub problems.

19
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,035
 So we had the following occurrence,

20
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:03,300
 T of N is at most three times T of N over two plus Order N we

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,115
 claim that this solves to Order N to the exponent log base two of three.

22
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:12,215
 And recall this exponent is roughly one point six.

23
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:13,800
 Now another recurrence which we saw in

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,480
 the median finding algorithm was T of N equals T of three

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,450
 fourths N and plus Order N. And we claim that

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,725
 this recurrence solves to order N. Now let's go ahead and solve these recurrences.

27
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:27,580
 We'll start with this recurrence.

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,097
 The naive algorithm for integer multiplication

29
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:32,850
 then we'll look at this slightly more complicated example.

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:32,850
 And finally we'll look at the general solution for these recurrences of this form.
