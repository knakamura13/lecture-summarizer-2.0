Unbounded linear programming (LP) implies infinite optimal value of the objective function. Consider an LP with variables x, y, maximizing x + y, subject to x - y ≤ 1, x + 5y ≥ 3, and non-negativity constraints. The feasible region lies in the upper right quadrant and is unbounded, extending beyond the y = 5 boundary shown. This region meets the half spaces defined by the constraints. The objective function's heat map and level sets, where x + y equals a constant value c, indicate that the function's value increases with higher y levels. As the y-value ascends, it demonstrates unbounded growth potential for the objective function within the feasible region, implying that for higher and unlimited values of c, the values of x and y can also be unbounded. The unbounded nature is specific to the objective function; different functions could reach optimum values at fixed points like vertices within the feasible region.
