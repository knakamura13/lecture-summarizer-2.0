1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 The solution to this quiz is false.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,910
 Now, why is this problem not in the class NP?

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,298
 Because if you give me a solution,

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,570
 and you claim it's of maximum size,

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,880
 I have no way to verify that it is,

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,860
 in fact, of maximum size.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,720
 The only way I can verify that it is of

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,924
 maximum size is if I can solve this problem in polynomial time.

9
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:22,590
 And that only holds if P equals NP.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,690
 So assuming P is not equal to NP,

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,280
 then the max independence set problem is not in the class NP.

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,720
 Now recall we had a similar scenario for the optimization version of knapsack problem.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,965
 When we looked at the version which tried to achieve the maximum value possible,

14
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,390
 that was not known to be in the class NP.

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,725
 But there was a simple fix so that the problem was in the class NP.

16
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:44,725
 So let's look at the search version of the independent set.
