The input to the SAT problem is a formula f in conjunctive normal form, which is composed of n variables; x1 through xn, and m clauses. The output is a satisfying assignment if one exists. This is an assignment of true or false to each of the variables so that the formula evaluates to true. Now if there is no satisfying assignment, no assignment where the formula evaluates true, then we output no.
