For clause satisfaction encoding, each literal is represented by V_i or V_i'. A literal's presence in a clause is noted by a 3 in the nth+j digit of a total (t). S_j and S_j' serve as buffers, marked with a 1 in the same digit. Other numbers get a 0 in this digit, ensuring a sum of 3 if one, two, or all three literals are true. If no literals are true, the sum cannot reach 3, indicating unsatisfied clause. This process allows for the verification of clause satisfaction within a larger computational framework.
