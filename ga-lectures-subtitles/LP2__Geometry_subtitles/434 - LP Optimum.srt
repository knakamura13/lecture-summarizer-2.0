1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 Now, the key, once again,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,550
 for algorithms which solve linear programs is that the optimum is

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,000
 achieved at a vertex of the feasible region except for the following cases.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,035
 The two exceptions to this are when the LP is infeasible,

5
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:15,890
 and when the LP is unbounded.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,525
 An LP is infeasible means that the feasible region is empty.

7
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,980
 There are no points which satisfy all of the constraints.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,665
 Here's a simple example of an infeasible LP.

9
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:27,630
 We have two variables, x and y,

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,230
 and objective function is to maximize 5x minus 7y.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,401
 And this is subject to the following constraints,

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,560
 x plus y is at most one,

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,005
 3x plus 2y is at least six,

14
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,190
 and x and y are non-negative.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,190
 Now let's take a look at the feasible region for this LP.
