1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
 And let's look at some basic properties of polynomials.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,360
 Consider the polynomial A(x).

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,115
 There are two natural ways of representing the polynomial A(x).

4
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:11,276
 The first way, is by its coefficients,

5
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:14,310
 this is the vector A that we've been considering so far.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,010
 A second way, is by looking at the value of this polynomial A(x) at n points.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,590
 So, we take n points (x1), (x2),

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,460
 up to (xn) and and we evaluate this polynomial A(x) at these n points.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,200
 The key fact is that a polynomial of degree n minus one is

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,525
 uniquely determined by its values at any n distinct points.

11
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,590
 So, that this statement makes intuitive sense,

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,365
 the example to keep in mind is that of a line.

13
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,855
 A line is a degree one polynomial,

14
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:46,505
 and a line is defined by any two points on that line.

15
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:52,680
 And in general, a degree n-1 polynomial is defined by any n points on that polynomial.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,755
 The vector of coefficients is a more natural way to represent a polynomial.

17
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:01,520
 However, the values are more convenient for the purposes of multiplying polynomials.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,180
 We'll see this in a second.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,695
 Now, what FFT does,

20
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:10,200
 is it convert from coefficients to the values and values to coefficients.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,670
 So, it does this transformation between these two representations of the polynomial.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,290
 And the point is that coefficients is a more convenient way to represent a polynomial

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,750
 oftentimes but the values are more convenient for multiplying polynomials.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,808
 So, we'll take the coefficients as input,

25
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,790
 we'll convert them to the values.

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,380
 We'll multiply the polynomials and then we'll use

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,775
 FFT to convert it back to the coefficients once again.

28
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:39,325
 One important point is that FFT converts from the coefficients to the values,

29
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:42,990
 not for any choice of (X1) through (Xn) but

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,130
 for a particular well chosen set of points, (X1) through (Xn).

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,310
 And part of the beauty of the FFT algorithm comes from

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,775
 this choice of these points (X1) through (Xn).

33
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:55,527
 Before we dive into FFT,

34
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:55,527
 let's take a look at why the values are convenient for multiplying polynomials.
