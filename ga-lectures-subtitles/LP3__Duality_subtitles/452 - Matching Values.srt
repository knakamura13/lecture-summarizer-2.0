1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,235
 Now, in our original example of the dual LP,

2
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:06,780
 we use a specific primal LP where we had run simplex,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,910
 we found the point 200, 200,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,920
 100 and had profit the value of the objective function was 2400.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,040
 Now we were able to find a feasible Y where it's

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,045
 value of the objective function in dual LP was also 2400.

7
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:24,945
 So that established, that proved that the optimal value was at most

8
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:29,655
 2400 and since we achieved 2400 at this point X therefore,

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,195
 it was an optimal point.

10
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,990
 And in general, we have the following corollary of this theorem,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,575
 the weak duality theorem.

12
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:40,020
 If we find a feasible point X for the primal LP and a feasible Y

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,860
 for the dual LP where their values of the objective functions match.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,135
 So C transpose X equals B transpose Y.

15
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:53,225
 So, we have equality here which is what we achieved in that early example.

16
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,550
 Then what we can conclude from this weak duality theorem,

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,360
 is that X and Y are both optimal.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,940
 X is an optimal point for the primal LP.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,980
 It maximizes the objective function of

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,580
 the primal LP and Y is an optimal point for the dual LP.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,520
 It minimizes the objective function of the dual LP.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
 So, if we can find a feasible point X in

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,025
 the primal LP and a feasible point Y in the dual LP,

24
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,440
 where their objective functions match,

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,840
 then these two points are optimal.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,100
 Now, does there always exist a point X in the primal LP and

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,380
 the point Y in the dual LP where we have equality? Yes, there does.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,165
 That's the strong duality theorem.

29
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:35,670
 Under certain conditions, we have to have

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,770
 an optimal value for the primal LP and an optimal value for the dual LP.

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,430
 So, we need both the primal and the dual to be feasible and bounded.

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,030
 So, let's first discuss these special cases.

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,030
 The cases where one of them is infeasible or unbounded.
