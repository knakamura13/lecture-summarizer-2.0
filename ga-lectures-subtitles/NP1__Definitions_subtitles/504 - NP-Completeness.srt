1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,905
 I suppose that P is not equal to NP.

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:04,893
 Now looking at our diagram from before,

3
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:06,090
 that means that this donor,

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,485
 this separation between P and NP is non-empty.

5
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:14,965
 Therefore there are some such problems which can't be solved in polynomial time.

6
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:19,965
 They don't lie in the class P. What are the hard problems that lie in this donor?

7
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:24,840
 These intractable problems, these problems that we can't solve in polynomial time.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,510
 The answer is NP complete problems.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,280
 Now there may be other problems that lie in

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,400
 this class NP which do not lie in P. So they lie in

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,580
 this Donor but NP-complete problems are guaranteed to lie in this donor if it exists.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,035
 NP complete problems are the hardest problems in the class NP.

13
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,995
 Let me repeat that because it's very key.

14
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:49,440
 NP complete problems are the hardest in the class NP.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,475
 Now, what exactly do we mean by the hardest in the class?

16
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:56,712
 We mean that if P is not equal to NP then the following holds.

17
00:00:56,712 --> 00:01:00,495
 Then all the NP complete problems are not in the class P. So

18
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:06,870
 all NP complete problems cannot be solved in polynomial time if P is not equal to NP.

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,250
 So if P is not equal to NP,

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,935
 this donor is non-empty.

21
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:13,230
 There are some problems in NP which don't lie in P,

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,740
 so we can't solve them in polynomial time.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,400
 And what does NP complete mean?

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,755
 Well, these are the hardest in the class NP,

25
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,390
 so you can think of them as sort of as the outer layer of this donor.

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,870
 This outer layer are the NP complete problems.

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,290
 If there is some separation between these sets,

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,850
 then these NP complete problems are guaranteed to be in the difference.

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,975
 Now let's look at this statement more carefully.

30
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:38,280
 An equivalent statement is the contra-positive of it.

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,160
 Now what's the complement of all NP complete problems are not in P,

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,870
 where the compliment is that there exists in NP complete problem in

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,250
 P. In other words a NP complete problem can be solved in polynomial time.

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,950
 So, the complement of this conclusion that all NP complete problems are not in

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,365
 the class P is that there exists

36
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:02,395
 NP complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time.

37
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:06,570
 If this holds, then the complement of the hypothesis holds.

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,575
 The complement of the hypothesis is that P equals NP.

39
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,390
 If P equals NP,

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,515
 that means that all problems in the class NP can be solved in polynomial time.

41
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:20,935
 An equivalent statement to this one is that

42
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:24,900
 if there exists an NP complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time,

43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,155
 then all problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time.

44
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,405
 Hence to show that a problem such as set

45
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:34,770
 lies in this and the complete portion of the donut.

46
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,590
 We have to show that if there is a polynomial time algorithm for set then there

47
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,705
 is a polynomial time algorithm for all problems in the class NP.

48
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,550
 We have to show that if there is an algorithm for set which works in polynomial time,

49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,720
 we can use it as the black box to solve all problems NP in polynomial time.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,280
 To do that, we're going to take every problem in the class NP.

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,750
 Now, there are many problems in this class.

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,075
 I've just marked a few of them but we have to take all such problems.

53
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:05,755
 So we take all such problems and we have to show that

54
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:09,925
 each of these such problems have a reduction to set.

55
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:11,890
 If we can solve set in polynomial time,

56
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,230
 we can solve every such problem in the class NP in polynomial time.

57
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:17,230
 Let's look at this more precisely on the next two slides.
