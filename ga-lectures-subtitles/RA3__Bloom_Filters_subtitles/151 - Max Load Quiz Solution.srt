1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,755
 The solution is one_over_N,

2
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:04,355
 the probability that the max load is at least Log n,

3
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:05,430
 is at most one_over_N.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,430
 Let's go through it in more details to see why this is the case.
