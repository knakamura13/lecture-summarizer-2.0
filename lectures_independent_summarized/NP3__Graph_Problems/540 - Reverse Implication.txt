The text delivers a proof demonstrating the reverse implication in the context of computational complexity theory, specifically establishing the NP-completeness of the Independent Set problem via a reduction from the 3SAT problem. It is explained that an independent set of size M implies a satisfying assignment for the 3SAT instance since each clause (triangle) of the graph has a vertex (literal) which can be set to true without contradictionâ€”a result of not allowing both a literal and its negation (Xi and Xi bar) within the independent set due to added edges between them, thus avoiding false assignments. The proof confirms that the satisfaction of all clauses in the 3SAT formula corresponds to a valid assignment derived from the independent set of size at least M, solidifying the reduction's correctness. The absence of an independent set of size M, in turn, entails no satisfying assignment for the formula. This equivalence substantiates that the Independent Set problem is indeed NP-complete.
