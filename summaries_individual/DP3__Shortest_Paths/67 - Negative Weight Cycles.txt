Directed graph with edge weights that can be positive or negative. Need to find shortest path from start vertex S to all other vertices. Problem's complexity arises due to negative weight edges. Example shows changing an edge weight from -2 to -6 can create a negative cycle (B->A->E->B) where each iteration reduces path length by -1, allowing for an infinitely shorter path. In graphs with negative cycles, shortest path problem becomes undefined since path length can decrease infinitely. Alternately, if no negative cycle is reachable from S, the problem is well-defined, and shortest-path distances to all vertices can be computed. Goal: either find a reachable negative cycle or, if none exists, find shortest path lengths from S to all vertices using dynamic programming.
