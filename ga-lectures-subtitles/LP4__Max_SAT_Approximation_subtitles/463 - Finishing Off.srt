1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
 Now, once again, we wanted to look at the expected number

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,500
 of satisfied clauses for this random assignment.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,480
 We let W denote the random variable for the number of satisfied clauses,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,765
 and we let WJ denote whether clause CJ is satisfied or not.

5
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:17,575
 And then this simplified to a sum over J from 1 to M,

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:22,220
 of whether the expectation of whether clause CJ is satisfied or not.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,945
 And then we just prove that this expectation,

8
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,825
 the probability that clause CJ is satisfied,

9
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,625
 is at least 1/2.

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,780
 This is at least 1/2 for each of these M clauses.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,045
 Therefore, this whole sum is at least M over 2.

12
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:38,415
 So what we've shown is a randomized algorithm,

13
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:41,240
 which achieves a one half approximation factor,

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,820
 though it's simply the expected performance of this algorithm.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,330
 Now, it turns out we can de-randomize this algorithm.

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,710
 So we can find it's terministic algorithm which is

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,305
 guaranteed to find a 1/2 approximation,

18
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:54,165
 so the number of satisfied causes.

19
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:57,513
 And this uses the method of conditional expectations.

20
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:00,930
 It's quite simple, so let me quickly give you the idea of how it works.

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,070
 So we're going to run through the variables one by one,

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:09,240
 so let's let I go from 1 to N. Now we're going to try the two possible settings for XI,

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,590
 True or false, and we're going to compute the expected performance for each.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,180
 So given this setting for XI,

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,580
 and given a fixed setting for X1 trough XI-1.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,503
 So the early ones are fixed,

27
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:24,400
 and now we're trying both possible settings for XI.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,385
 We compute the expected performance for a random assignment for the remaining variables.

29
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:31,655
 XI+1 to XN.

30
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:34,020
 Now this expected performance is quite easy to

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,170
 compute based on the analysis approach we just did.

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,425
 And what we're going to do is we're going to take the better of these two assignments,

33
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:41,770
 and then we're going to fix it,

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,070
 and then we're going to move on to the next variable.

35
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,830
 Now one interesting feature is that we're not saying

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,210
 something about the optimal number of satisfied clauses.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,505
 For instance, our formula F might have 12 clauses,

38
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:59,145
 and maybe the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied simultaneously is maybe 10.

39
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:01,515
 So M* in this instance would be 10,

40
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:03,415
 and M would be 12.

41
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,360
 Now, what we're proving is that a random assignment

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,510
 satisfies at least six of the clauses.

43
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,735
 Now since sets within a factor of 2 of the total number of clauses,

44
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:19,688
 therefore we're within half approximation of the maximum number of satisfied clauses.

45
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:22,890
 And actually, what was shown is that every formula

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,140
 has an assignment which satisfies at least half of the clauses.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,045
 Intuitively, if the average is at least M/2,

48
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:30,045
 there must be at least one setting which achieves the average.
