1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,395
 It remains to prove this key fact that if S is a sink component then S bar,

2
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:09,175
 its complement, is a source component and vice versa.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,385
 If S bar is a source then S is a sink.

4
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:14,260
 In order to prove this key fact,

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,155
 we're going to look at a simpler claim. Here's the claim.

6
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:22,870
 If we have a pair of literals alpha and beta and if there is a path from alpha to beta,

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,910
 then there's a path from beta bar to

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,430
 alpha bar and if there's a path from beta bar to alpha bar,

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,870
 then there's a path from alpha to beta.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,940
 Now this claim looks much easier to prove.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,700
 Let's assume the claim for now and let's go back and prove this key fact.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,380
 Let's prove that if S is a sink then S bar is a source and vice versa.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,070
 So take a sink component S and we're going to prove that S bar is a source component.

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,760
 Now take a pair of vertices in this sinc component

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,725
 S. So these vertices correspond to literals alpha and beta.

16
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:59,024
 Let's say alpha and beta R and S. So what do we know?

17
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,300
 We know that alpha and beta are strongly connected to

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,475
 each other because they're in the same strongly connected component.

19
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:09,060
 If they're strongly connected with each other that means we have paths between the pair.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,630
 So we have a path from alpha to beta and a path from beta to alpha.

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,120
 That's the definition of being strongly connected.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,095
 Now what does our claim imply?

23
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:21,530
 Well if there is a path from alpha to beta which is what we know,

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,820
 then there is a path from beta bar to alpha bar and this path from beta to alpha

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,105
 again applying the claim then that means that we have a path from alpha bar to beta bar.

26
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:36,505
 So what does that mean? That means that alpha bar

27
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:39,095
 and beta bar are strongly connected with each other,

28
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,825
 so they lie in the same SCC.

29
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,130
 So if alpha and beta are in S then we know that

30
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,380
 alpha bar and beta bar are in S bar in SCC.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,195
 So what we've shown is for pairs of vertices in S,

32
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:56,395
 then their complements form an SCC.

33
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:57,947
 For alpha and beta in S,

34
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:01,955
 alpha bar and beta bar must be in the same SCC.

35
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,885
 So if all pairs over here are strongly connected,

36
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:09,455
 then their complements or pairs are strongly connected.

37
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:14,290
 So, these guys form SCC their complement forms an SCC.

38
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,235
 Now this is part of what we wanted to prove.

39
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,250
 We wanted to prove that if S is a sink SCC

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,830
 then S bar is a source SCC. What have we shown so far?

41
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,790
 We've shown that if S is a SCC then as S bar is an SCC but

42
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,800
 we haven't shown anything about a sink implies

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,915
 a source and vice versa. But we're halfway there.

44
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,080
 We've shown that if S is an SCC,

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,860
 then its complement is an SCC and vice versa.

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,200
 You can do the same proof in reverse.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,930
 And now if S bar is in SCC then its complement is also in SCC.

48
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:46,930
 Now let's prove the last part about sink implies source and vice versa.
