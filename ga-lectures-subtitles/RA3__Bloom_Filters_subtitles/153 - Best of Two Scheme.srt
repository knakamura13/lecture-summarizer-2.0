1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,845
 Now, let's look at the following twist on the balls and bins problem.

2
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:05,429
 This is going to be a better approach,

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:08,215
 better in the sense that it's going to reduce the max load.

4
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:10,175
 Now, in the previous balls and bins problem,

5
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,500
 each ball was going to a random bin and it was

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,150
 independent of the assignment for the other balls.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,150
 Therefore, we could have assigned all the balls simultaneously, in parallel.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,420
 They could have all been assigned to bins at the same time,

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,155
 or we could assign them one by one, sort of sequentially.

10
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:30,620
 So, we could have taken ball one and assigned it to a random bin,

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,880
 take ball two, assign to a random bin,

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,825
 and so on, up to ball n. That's what we're going to do here.

13
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,860
 We're going to assign the balls sequentially,

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,855
 and we're going to look at a slight twist of the other scheme.

15
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,989
 So, let's go through the balls from one through n,

16
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,355
 index i will correspond to the current ball that we're considering.

17
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,670
 In the old scheme, we choose one random bin say j,

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,410
 and we assigned the i ball to bin bj.

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,100
 Now, in the new scheme what we're going to do is,

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,815
 we're going to choose two random bins,

21
00:00:57,815 --> 00:01:00,395
 say j and k. Now,

22
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:03,930
 which bin are we going to assign the ith ball?

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,530
 Well we're going to assign it to the better of these two bins.

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,850
 What exactly do we mean?

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,460
 We mean the one which has smaller load.

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,365
 So, let load of j and load of k

27
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,435
 denote the current load in these particular bins bj and bk,

28
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:21,750
 and we're going to assign this ith ball to the least loaded of these two.

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,105
 So if the load of bj is structurally smaller than the load of bk,

30
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:29,900
 then we assign the ith ball to bin bj.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,540
 And in the other case, we assign the ith ball to bin bk.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,540
 So, the ith ball is going to the least loaded of these two bins.
