00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 Here is our new problem formulation.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,250
 The input is an undirected graph corresponding to the image,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,755
 once again, and we're given the following weights.

4
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:10,595
 For each pixel, for each vertex I,

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:14,445
 we're given fi and bi and these are non-negative weights.

6
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:15,845
 And, for each edge,

7
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,550
 we are given the weight Pij,

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,070
 which is also non-negative.

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,935
 And, our goal is to find the partition of the vertices or pixels into two sets,

10
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:27,480
 F and B, and we want the partition which minimizes the weight,

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,310
 w prime of FB.

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,555
 Recall the partition, FB,

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:34,260
 which minimizes w prime of FB,

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,920
 is the same partition which maximizes w

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,330
 of FB and therefore it solves the original image segmentation problem.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,330
 Now, let's see how to reduce this to the max flow problem.
