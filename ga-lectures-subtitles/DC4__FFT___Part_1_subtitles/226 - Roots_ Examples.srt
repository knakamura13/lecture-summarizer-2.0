1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,436
 That we saw that for the case n equals 2,

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:06,905
 the square roots of unity are the points 1 and minus one.

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:08,730
 For the case n equals 4,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,205
 we also have the points i and minus i so we have the four points 1_i minus 1 minus i.

5
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:20,230
 This corresponds to going around the unit circle in step sizes of space Pi over 2.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,970
 And for n equals 8, we further subdivide the unit circle.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,008
 Now we go step sizes of Pi over 4 and then how do we get the points for n equal 16?

8
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,963
 We further subdivide.

9
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,650
 So this corresponds to omega_sub_16.

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,898
 The next one is omega_sub_16 squared and notice that it's also omega_sub_8.

11
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:41,970
 It's the first one of the eighth roots of unity.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,130
 And this point i is omega_sub_16 to the fourth power,

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,110
 it's also omega_sub_8 squared,

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,115
 it's the second one of the 8th roots.

15
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:53,520
 And it's the first of the 4th roots.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,520
 So take the nth roots and square them.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,950
 And let's suppose that n is a power of 2 as in these examples.

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,015
 So what happens when you take the 16th root square?

19
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,445
 Well this guy goes there,

20
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:08,550
 this one goes there, this one goes there,

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,783
 this one goes there. What do you get?

22
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:13,680
 You get every other one of the 16th roots,

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,370
 which are the 8th roots so the 16th root squared are the 8th roots.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,050
 And when n is a power of 2,

25
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,040
 the nth root squared are the n over 2nd second roots.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,150
 The other key property is this plus minus property.

27
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,354
 Take this point omega_sub_16.

28
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:31,725
 What is the opposite of it?

29
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,120
 It's this point right here.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,570
 This is negative omega_sub_16.

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,440
 It's also a 16th root of unity. Which one is it?

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,310
 Well, this is the 1st first, this is the 8th,

33
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,445
 this is the 9th.

34
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,635
 This is the point omega_sub_16 to the 9th power.

35
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,945
 And in general, for even n,

36
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:55,080
 omega_sub_n to the jth power is opposite omega_sub_n to the j plus n over two.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,080
 By going an extra n over 2, I'm going an extra Pi around so I'm getting the reflection
