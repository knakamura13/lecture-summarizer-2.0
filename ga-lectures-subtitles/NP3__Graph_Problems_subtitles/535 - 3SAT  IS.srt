1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,855
 So take an input to the three subproblem,

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:05,115
 it is defined by a formula F,

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:09,035
 and we'll say the formula F has variables X1 through Xn,

4
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:10,915
 and clauses C1 through CM.

5
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,580
 So it has N variables and M clauses.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,875
 And now we have to find an input to the independent set problem.

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,955
 And recall since this is three set,

8
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:21,120
 each of the clauses has size at most three,

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,418
 so it contains one,

10
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:23,900
 two or three literals.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,180
 The input to the independence set problem is a graph G. We're

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,655
 going to define a graph G based on this formula F,

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,970
 which is the input to the three set problem.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,700
 We also need to specify our goal little g. It

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,353
 turns out we're going to set our goal g to be M,

16
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:40,715
 the number of clauses.

17
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:45,210
 Here's the high level ideal for the construction of our graph G. For each of the clauses,

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,640
 we're going to create a vertex in our graph

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,210
 G corresponding to each of the literals in this clause.

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,770
 So this clause has three literals,

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,610
 then we're going to create three vertices.

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,175
 Since there are M clauses,

23
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:59,940
 there's going to be at most three M vertices in our graph

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,540
 G. And then we're going to add edges to encode this clause.

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,180
 And then we're going to add additional edges between vertices in different clauses,

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,855
 in order to ensure a consistent assignment.

27
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:10,855
 Let's define it more precisely.
