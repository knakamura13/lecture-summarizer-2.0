Let me give you a quick reminder of the formulation of the 3SAT problem. So the input to the 3SAT problem is a boolean formula f in conjunctive normal form and we use n for the number of variables and m for the number of clauses in the formula f. Now the extra restriction in 3SAT as opposed to SAT is that we assume this formula f has the following constraint. Each clause has at most three literals. Now the output for the 3SAT problem is a satisfying assignment if one exists. This is an assignment of true and false to the n variables, so that the formula f evaluates to true. Now if there's no satisfying assignment, we simply output-
