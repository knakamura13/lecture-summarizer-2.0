To demonstrate the equivalence between the original formula f and the new formula f', it's established that an assignment satisfying f can also satisfy f' and vice versa. When a clause C in f has more than three literals, it's replaced by a sequence called C' with additional variables exclusive to C'. These extra variables can be set independently without impacting other clauses. For C', a specific assignment strategy achieves satisfaction: taking the first satisfied literal in C, setting the preceding variables to true, and the rest to false satisfies C'. Conversely, a satisfying assignment to f' implies at least one literal in the original clause C must be true, as C' couldn't be satisfied otherwise. Therefore, the original variables' assignment satisfies f, disregarding the new variables. This forms a bidirectional satisfaction, thereby proving the formulas' equivalence.
