1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
 Let's look at the standard form for linear programs.

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,820
 We have n variables x1 through xn.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,500
 Our objective function is to maximize a linear function of these n variables.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,509
 We have these coefficients, c1 through cn,

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:18,690
 and we're maximizing this linear function of the n variables.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,364
 We're optimizing subject to the m constraints.

7
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:26,214
 The first constraint is specified by a11 through a1n.

8
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:30,335
 These are the coefficients for x1 through xn.

9
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:35,399
 We want that this linear function is at most b1 for a given b1.

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,130
 This is the first constraint.

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,119
 There are n constraints.

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,229
 The mth constraint is specified by am1 through amn,

13
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:48,729
 that specifies the left hand side and we want this to be a most mn.

14
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:52,125
 And finally, we also have the non-negativity constraint.

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,679
 We want that these n variables are non-negative.

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,659
 We have m plus n constraints.

17
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,024
 We can specify this more compactly using linear algebra.

18
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:02,024
 Let's go ahead and do that.
