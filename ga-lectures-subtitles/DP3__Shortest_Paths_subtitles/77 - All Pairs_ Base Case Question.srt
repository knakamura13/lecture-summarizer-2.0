00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,092
 Let's go ahead and try to find the recurrence for the sub-problem we just defined.

2
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:07,935
 The sub-problem we just defined was D of IST.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,565
 This is the length of the shortest path from vertex S to vertex T,

4
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:16,410
 where the set of allowed vertices on the path from S to T

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,600
 are a prefix of the vertex N. These are the first I vertices, one through I.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,080
 These are the vertices that are allowed to be

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,210
 intermediate vertices on the path from S to T. Let's start with the base case.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,130
 Why don't you go ahead and write down what is

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,800
 the base case and what is the solution to the base case?

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,030
 For intuition about the solution for the base case and what is the base case itself,

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,030
 think back to the Bellman-Ford algorithm for the single source problem.
