Repeated squaring algorithm involves comput. X_mod_N (a_one), squaring to get X^2_mod_N (a_one squared), & skipping cubes for powers of 2 (X^4, X^8, through a_two, a_four, etc.). Each new term, a_n, is derived by squaring the prev. one, applicable to X to powers of 2. Calculate X^Y_mod_N by referencing Y's binary form & combining calculated powers of 2. Example clarifies the method.
