1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
 Now let's finish off the rest of the proof of this key fact.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,100
 What have we shown so far?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,135
 We've shown that if we take a sink SCC S,

4
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:11,460
 then its complement is a SCC.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,975
 Now we have to show that S bar is also a source SCC.

6
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,180
 So we have to show that if this is a sink,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,720
 then this is a source.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,540
 Now, since S is a sink SCC,

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,815
 if we take a vertex,

10
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,380
 a literal in S,

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,830
 then we know that alpha has no outgoing edges.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,640
 So there's no edges of the form alpha to beta for any beta.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,505
 Now, if there are no edges from alpha to beta,

14
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:37,860
 then what does the claim imply?

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,670
 That implies that there are no edges into alpha bar.

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,145
 So if there are no outgoing edges from alpha,

17
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,250
 then there are no incoming edges to alpha bar.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,295
 So if for all alpha in S there are no incoming edges to the complement of alpha,

19
00:00:53,295 --> 00:01:00,030
 then that means that the complement of S bar has no incoming edges.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,015
 So that means that as S bar is a source SCC.

21
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:06,480
 So we've shown that if S is a sink SCC,

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,735
 then by this claim,

23
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,335
 S bar must be a source SCC.

24
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:14,340
 And we can do the argument in reverse and show that if S bar is a source,

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,885
 then S is a sink SCC.

26
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:20,060
 So we've shown that if S is a sink SCC,

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,505
 then S bar is a source SCC.

28
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:25,440
 And that proves the key fact.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,440
 Now it just remains to prove this claim.
