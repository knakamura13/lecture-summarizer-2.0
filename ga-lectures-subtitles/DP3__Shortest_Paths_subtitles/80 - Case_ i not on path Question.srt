00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
 Let's pause for a moment and you go ahead and think about what

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,790
 is the solution to the recurrence in this case,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,990
 where vertex i is not on the shortest path from s to t. And so,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,434
 can we express D(i, s,

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:11,434
 t) in terms of smaller subproblem?
