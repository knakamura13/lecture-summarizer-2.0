Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for max-flow problem has a pseudo-polynomial running time of O(MC), depending on integer capacities (C). This is problematic as ideal algorithms should not be influenced by input magnitudes. Edmonds-Karp modifies Ford-Fulkerson by using the shortest path (minimum edges) in the residual network, leading to O(MÂ²N) run time, which doesn't depend on max-flow size or integer capacities. Orlin's 2013 algorithm further improves the runtime to O(MN), the best known for max-flow on general graphs.
