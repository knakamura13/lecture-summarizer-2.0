1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,806
 First off, what are the variables in our linear program?

2
00:00:02,806 --> 00:00:07,650
 What we're trying to determine how many units of A and B to produce each day?

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,279
 Hence, let x1 be the number of units of A that we should produce

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,564
 per day and x2 is the number of units of B to produce per day.

5
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,614
 Our goal is to maximize the profit.

6
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:19,765
 So we have a maximization problem.

7
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:22,695
 Now, how do we express the profit in terms of x1 and x2?

8
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,660
 Well, we make a profit of $1 per unit of A,

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,030
 so that's x1 and $6 per unit of B that we sell.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,574
 So, that's 6x2.

11
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,950
 Now what are the constraints?

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,579
 First off, the demand constraint.

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,445
 Well, we want to make at most 300 units of A.

14
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:42,064
 So, this means that x1 is at most 300 and x2 is at most 200.

15
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:45,179
 Now, also we want x1 and x2 to be non-negative.

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,134
 We can't produce a negative amount of any of the products.

17
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,719
 So, let's throw in these non-negative constraints.

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,765
 Now let's look at the supply constraint.

19
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:55,880
 The total supply, the total number of man hours available is

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,164
 700 and it takes one hour per unit of A and three hours per unit of B.

21
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:01,164
 So, we want that x1 plus 3x2 is at most 700.
