Divide and conquer algorithms, like binary search and merge sort, are powerful for solving complex problems. We'll explore this by examining how to multiply very large numbers of thousands of bits, which is significant in applications such as RSA encryption. Since these numbers are too large for hardware implementation, a fast and clever divide and conquer approach outperforms the standard multiplication method. We will also examine finding the median in an unsorted list of numbers, utilizing another ingenious divide and conquer strategy that avoids the need to sort the list. Lastly, the FFT algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform, is highlighted for its critical role in multiple disciplines, notably signal processing, and is considered one of the most important numerical algorithms. Understanding FFT requires a grasp of complex numbers, but mastering this concept reveals the elegance and simplicity of the algorithm, making the investment in learning it worthwhile due to its profound impact and widespread usage.
