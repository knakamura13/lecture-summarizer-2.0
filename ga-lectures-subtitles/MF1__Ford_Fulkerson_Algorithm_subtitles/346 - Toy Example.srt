1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
 Now it'll be useful to have

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,680
 a small toy example to work with when we devise our algorithms.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,955
 So let's look at this following example.

4
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:08,725
 It only has four vertices.

5
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:11,360
 It's quite easy to find a max flow in this network.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,560
 Here's a max flow in this network.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,260
 Notice this flow is of size 17.

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,780
 Therefore it's clearly maximum because it achieves the capacity into t and also

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,150
 the capacity out of s. Now we're going to use

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,150
 this toy example as a running example to try out our right.
