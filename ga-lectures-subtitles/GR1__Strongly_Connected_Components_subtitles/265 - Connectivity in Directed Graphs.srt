00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
 We're looking now at connectivity in directed graphs.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,270
 So the remainder of the lecture we're going to be talking about directed graphs.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,740
 First off, we have to talk about what is

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,175
 the correct notion of connectivity between a pair of vertices.

5
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,535
 So let us take a pair of vertices,

6
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:16,285
 V and W and we we'll say they're strongly connected.

7
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:19,880
 If there's a path from V to W and W to V. I have

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,600
 this vertex V and this vertex W and there's a path from V to W,

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,040
 it may pass through many vertices on the way and there's a path from

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,300
 W to V that may pass through many vertices along the way and these paths may intersect.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,495
 So these vertices V and W are strongly connected.

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,625
 So instead of connected components in undirected graphs,

13
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,010
 the analog for directed graphs is going to be

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,835
 strongly connected components which we'll denote as SCC.

15
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,425
 Now an undirected graphs,

16
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,925
 the connected component is a maximal set of connected vertices.

17
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:54,815
 We keep adding in connected vertices as long as we can.

18
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,810
 For directed graphs, strongly connected components

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,935
 are the maximal set of strongly connected vertices.

20
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,500
 So we keep adding in strongly connected vertices as long as we can.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,750
 Let's take a look at a specific example and mark

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:06,750
 the strongly connected components in the example to make sure everybody understands it.
