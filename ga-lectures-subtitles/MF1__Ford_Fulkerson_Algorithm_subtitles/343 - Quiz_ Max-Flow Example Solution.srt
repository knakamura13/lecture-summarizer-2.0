1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
 Now, here's a flow of maximum size.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,290
 The flow is specified by the green numbers along every edge and their capacities,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,590
 once again, are specified by the red numbers along every edge.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,060
 Now, notice for every vertex,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,060
 the flow in equals the flow out.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,945
 For instance, for vertex c,

7
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:19,430
 the flow in is seven and the flow out is seven.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,930
 For vertex e, the flow in is one plus one which is two and the flow out is two.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,670
 For vertex d, the flow in is seven and the flow out is seven.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,160
 And all of the flows along the edges are

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,205
 upper bounded by the capacities along those edges.

12
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:39,090
 And finally, the total flow size is of size 12.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,240
 This is 12 units of flow coming out of s

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,495
 and there's 12 units of flow coming into t. Now for this example,

15
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,320
 why do we know that this is the maximum flow?

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,065
 What the total capacity of edge is coming into t is 12,

17
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,730
 so the maximum amount of flow that can come into t is at

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,880
 most,12 and we've achieved that therefore,

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:00:59,880
 we've achieved the maximum flow.
