1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
 Let's go ahead and detail the extended Euclid algorithm.

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,910
 Recall, it takes two parameters as input X and Y where

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,105
 X is at least Y and we're going to output three parameters.

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,940
 D alpha and beta.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,670
 D is the GCD.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,250
 So, if we just look at the first parameter,

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,415
 it's going to behave like Euclid's algorithm

8
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:19,005
 and we're also going to output this alpha and this beta,

9
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,525
 which satisfy this relation.

10
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,575
 Let's start again with the base case.

11
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:24,760
 So, when Y equals zero, where do we return.?

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,520
 Well, the first parameter D is the GCD.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,990
 So, that should be equal to X.

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,000
 Now, we want to find alpha and beta which satisfy the relation,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,025
 where D in this case is equal to X.

16
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:39,860
 So, we want X equals X times alpha plus Y times beta.

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,250
 Well, that's easier to satisfy.

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,005
 We can just say alpha equal to one,

19
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:44,785
 and beta equal to zero.

20
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:46,820
 That takes care of the base case.

21
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,880
 Now, for the general case,

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,500
 we're going to use Euclid's rule,

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,305
 which says that the GCD of X and Y is equal to the GCD of Y and X mod Y.

24
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,730
 So, we recursively call this algorithm on Y and X mod Y.

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,610
 That's going to return three numbers, D, alpha, beta.

26
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,580
 Let's call it D alpha prime, beta prime.

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,700
 Now, we're going to have to do a little bit of manipulation of these three parameters,

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,900
 in order to get our output for X and Y.

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,830
 Now, we know the first parameter stays the same.

30
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,890
 The GCD of these two parameters is the same as the GCD of X and Y.

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,415
 Now, what do we know about alpha prime and beta prime?

32
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:31,810
 Well, we know that D equals Y times alpha prime plus X mod Y times beta prime.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,755
 Now, in order to find an alpha and beta which satisfy this relation for X and Y,

34
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:39,970
 we have to do some algebra to manipulate this alpha prime and beta prime.

35
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,990
 It turns out that it's sufficient to set alpha equal to beta prime,

36
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,150
 and we set beta equal to alpha prime minus X divided by Y,

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,970
 rounded down times beta prime.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,920
 In order to see where this quantity comes from,

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,590
 you got to look at the proof of correctness which is not too bad,

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,715
 but it's just a bit of algebra.

41
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,500
 I'll refer you to the textbook for the details on that proof of correctness.

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,130
 That completes its pseudo code for the extended Euclid algorithm.

43
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,110
 Finally, what's the running time with this algorithm?

44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,395
 Well notice, each step,

45
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:16,450
 the non-trivial operations are X mod Y and there's little bit of algebra, right here.

46
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,910
 So, it takes order N squared time per round,

47
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,225
 and the number of rounds is order N just like Euclid's algorithm.

48
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:22,225
 So the total run time is order N cube time.
