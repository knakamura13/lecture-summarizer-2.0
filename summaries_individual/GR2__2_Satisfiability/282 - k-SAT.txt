Assigning X_1=false, X_2=true, X_3=false satisfies the given clauses in the formula. k-SAT is a specific SAT problem variant where each clause has at most k literals; the example provided is 3-SAT but applies to all k>=3. SAT, including k-SAT for k>=3, is NP-complete, indicating no known polynomial-time solutions for these cases. However, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for 2-SAT which can be solved using strongly connected components, marking a sharp contrast to the complexity of k-SAT for k>=3.
