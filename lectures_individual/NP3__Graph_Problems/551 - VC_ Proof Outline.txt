to prove that the vertex cover problem is np-complete there are two parts the first part once again is to prove that it's in the class and P so consider an input to the vertex cover problem a graph capital G and a budget little B and consider a proposed solution capital S this is a proposed vertex cover in the graph G can we verify in polynomial time that ass is a vertex cover of requisite size in the input graph G first in order to verify that s is a vertex cover we have to check every edge of the graph and we have to check that at least one of the two endpoints is in set s this can be done in linear time in order n plus M time next we have checked that the set s is sufficiently small this can easily be done in linear time in order n time this shows that in polynomial time we can verify that s is a solution to this input instance now we can do the second more non-trivial aspect of the proof now we have to show that the vertex cover problem is at least as hard as every problem in the class NP so we have to take a known np-complete problem we now have four problems that we know are np-complete sad 3sat independent set and clique and we have to reduce one of them to the vertex cover problem it's most natural to take one of the graph problems either independent set or Klee these are quite similar to each other so it doesn't matter too much we're gonna take independent set problem and reduce it to the vertex cover problem now let's do the reduction from the independent set problem to the vertex cover problem
