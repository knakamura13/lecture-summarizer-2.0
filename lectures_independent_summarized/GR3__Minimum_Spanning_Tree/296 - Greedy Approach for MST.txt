Exploring the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem with a greedy approach on a weighted graph, the process includes sequentially choosing edges of increasing weight and adding them to an initially empty MST, ensuring no cycles form. Starting with the cycle edges—weighted one through six—each edge is added until the edge with a weight of six, which would create a cycle if included. Subsequently, edges weighted seven are all added, as they don't form cycles. With edges weighted nine, all but the last are added. The final edge of weight nine isn't included as it connects vertices V and W, which are already connected and would create a cycle. The heaviest edges, weighted twelve, are excluded for the same reason. The result of this process is an MST for the graph.
