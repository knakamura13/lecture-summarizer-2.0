00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,815
 Here's an example of a specific directed graph on eight vertices.

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:06,840
 Now lets run our DFS algorithm for directed graphs on

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,450
 this specific example starting at the vertex B.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,765
 And for concreteness we'll assume that the linked lists are stored in alphabetical order.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,525
 So when we look at the edges out of B for example,

6
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:21,315
 we're going to see A and C then

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:25,320
 E. And let's look at the tree of explored edges in our DFS run.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,820
 We're going to start at the vertex B,

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,060
 so this is going to be the root of the tree.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,500
 And let's keep track of the pre-order and post-order numbers

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,485
 of the vertices as they are stored.

12
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:34,815
 We start exploring from B,

13
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:36,740
 so it gets a pre-order number.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,725
 We first see neighbor A of vertex B.

15
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:43,020
 So the next edge that we explore is the edge B to A.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,445
 We then assign of pre-order number to A.

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,750
 We then see vertex D and we give it its pre-order number.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,990
 Then exploring from vertex D we see vertex E and then from

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,545
 vertex E we see vertex G. G gets pre-order number five.

20
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:58,935
 But notice from G there's nothing to explore.

21
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:02,400
 So we're going to pop back up from G back up to E. So we're going to

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,685
 finish exploring from G so we can give it post order number six.

23
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:10,045
 Now notice from Vertex E when we do explore from E,

24
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,780
 it was in an an edge from E to A.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,453
 A has already been explored,

26
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,920
 has already been visited at that time.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,690
 So we're not going to rerun explorer from A.

28
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,350
 This is not an edge in the DFS tree in the sense

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,735
 that A has already been explored at this time.

30
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:30,000
 So we're not going to rerun explorer from A but let's keep track of this edge and

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,205
 mark it as blue edge in order to distinguish it

32
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:35,070
 from the explored edges which are marked as black.

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,010
 After we've explored the two edges out of E to

34
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,160
 A and to G then we're going to pop back up to

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,130
 Vertex D. But first we're going to assign a post order number

36
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,700
 to E. Now from D we're going to see this edge to H,

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,760
 so we're going to explore from H. Now from H we

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,240
 see this neighbor G. G has already been visited,

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,385
 so let's mark this edge from H to G as a blue edge.

40
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,030
 Then we're going to finish exploring from H and we're going to pop

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,345
 back up to D. Lets assign its pre or post order numbers.

42
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,895
 From D there was an additional edge to G.

43
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,490
 Then we can assign its post order number and pop back up to A.

44
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,025
 A is done and then we can pop back up to B.

45
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:14,295
 From vertex B we're going to see vertex C and then F,

46
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,140
 so we're going to get this right sub-tree.

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,555
 Now from F we're going to see this edge back to B,

48
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,280
 that's a blue edge,

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,230
 and we're going to see this edge across to

50
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,070
 H and we can send the pre-order post-order numbers.

51
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,070
 And that completes the DFS run for this example.
