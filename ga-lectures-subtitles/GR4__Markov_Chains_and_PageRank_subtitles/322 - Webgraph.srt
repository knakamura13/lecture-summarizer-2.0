1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,410
 We're going to look at the so called Web graph.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,145
 The graph on web pages.

3
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:05,800
 What exactly is our graph?

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,585
 Well the vertices of our graph are going to be web pages.

5
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:10,126
 Now this the humongous graph,

6
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:12,530
 because we have a vertex for every web page

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,105
 and the edges of our graphs are the hyperlinks.

8
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,585
 Now these are directed edges.

9
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,780
 A web page X might have a hyperlink to

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,195
 a web page Y or Y doesn't necessarily have a hyperlink back to X.

11
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,355
 So it's important we think of these edges as directed edges.

12
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:29,003
 Now let's introduce some notation,

13
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:34,440
 for a web page. X, let's define pi of X to be the rank of this page.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,620
 Now the rank is our measure of the importance of the web page.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,590
 Now rank or importance are subjective terms.

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,455
 We need to define pi of X,

17
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,250
 the rank in a sensible way.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,600
 Now of course sensible is also a subjective term,

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,830
 but in any case we're going to define pi of X so that it has

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,610
 a very nice natural mathematical interpretation.

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,610
 Now if you just watched the bit about markup change, you might think.

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,000
 Why is he using pi once again?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,710
 Well it's not a coincidence,

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,550
 before we used pi to correspond to

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,960
 the stationary distribution and that's going to come out later,

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,275
 but for now once again we're not going to talk about Markov chains.

27
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,760
 Now it would be useful to have a little bit on notation.

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,855
 So let's consider a page X is the vertex in our graph,

29
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:18,020
 so it's denoted here.

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,945
 Now there are a bunch of hyperlinks at the web page X.

31
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:23,645
 Those are directed edges out of X.

32
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:29,610
 We want some notation for this set of neighbors which have edges from X to them.

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,225
 So we're going to find this set out of X.

34
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,800
 So for a web page X,

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,340
 out of X are the out neighbors of X.

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,485
 These are the web pages which have a hyperlink from X to them.

37
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,425
 So these are the web pages Y,

38
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,565
 where there's a hyperlink from X to Y,

39
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:47,800
 there is a directed edge from X to Y.

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,845
 So out of X are the set of all Ys such that there's a link from X to Y.

41
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,040
 Similarly, we're going to have to look at the set of web pages or

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,090
 vertices which have a link to X.

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,130
 So we'll let In of X denote the set of in neighbors of X.

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,205
 This is a set of web pages W,

45
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:07,690
 which have a hyperlink from W to X.

46
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,485
 So there's a direct edge from W to X.

47
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,790
 So just remember, out of X are the out neighbors

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,290
 of X and in of X are the in neighbors of X.

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:17,290
 This is the only totation that we'll need.
