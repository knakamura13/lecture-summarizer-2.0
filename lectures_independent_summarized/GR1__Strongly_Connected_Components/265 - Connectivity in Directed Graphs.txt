Exploring directed graph connectivity, focusing on the concept of strong connectivity defined by the presence of reciprocal paths between two vertices V and W, such that each can be reached from the other. This introduces the idea of strongly connected components (SCCs) in directed graphs, which resemble connected components in undirected graphs but require bidirectional connectivity. SCCs consist of the largest possible subsets of vertices that are strongly connected. The concept was further clarified using a specific example to illustrate the identification of SCCs within a graph.
