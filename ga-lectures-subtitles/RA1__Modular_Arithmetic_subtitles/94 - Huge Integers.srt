00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,385
 Lets look at the context of the RSA algorithm.

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:05,970
 In cryptography, we're going to work with N-bit numbers X,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,770
 Y and N. For example,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,640
 the number of bits in these numbers is going to be huge.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,000
 Think of the number of bits as 1024 or 2048.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,625
 It's a huge number of bits.

7
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:23,235
 So normally, we thought of our arithmetic operations as built into hardware,

8
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:27,755
 but that usually restricts the attention to 64 bits or so.

9
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:30,600
 But here we're talking about 1000 or 2000 bits.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:30,600
 So we have to go back and review how long does it take for basic arithmetic operations.
