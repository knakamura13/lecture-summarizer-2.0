00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,525
 Now, how can we check whether our LP is feasible or infeasible?

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:06,610
 And if it is feasible, how can we check whether it's unbounded or not?

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,755
 Let's first address how we determine whether it's feasible or not,

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:10,830
 and later in the lecture,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,780
 we'll address whether it's unbounded or not.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,020
 To figure out whether a feasible LP is unbounded or bounded,

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,815
 we're going to have to look at the dual LP.

8
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:22,410
 So we'll defer that discussion until after we discuss duality.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:22,410
 Let's look now at how we determine whether an LP is infeasible.
