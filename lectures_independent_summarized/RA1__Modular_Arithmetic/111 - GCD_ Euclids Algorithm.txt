Euclid's GCD algorithm is a recursive method for finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two non-negative integers, x and y, where x is greater than or equal to y. The base case occurs when y equals zero; the gcd is then simply x. In all other cases, the algorithm applies Euclid's Rule, stating that the gcd of x and y is the same as the gcd of x mod y (the remainder of x divided by y) and y. The recursion involves flipping the order of the parameters to ensure the first remains larger. The algorithm returns the gcd of x and y. There's a need for further discussion to clarify confusion around the base case.
