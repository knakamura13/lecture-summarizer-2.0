1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,905
 Now here's an example of a graph on five vertices.

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:06,115
 Why don't you go ahead and give a topological ordering for this graph.

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,880
 There are five vertices, so let's write down the vertices in

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,330
 order so that all edges go from left to right.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,450
 Now this graph happens to have multiple topological orderings.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,015
 How many topological orderings does it in fact have?

7
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:20,085
 To make sure you understand topological orderings,

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,870
 why don't you go ahead and specify the number of

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:21,870
 topological orderings which are valid for this graph.
