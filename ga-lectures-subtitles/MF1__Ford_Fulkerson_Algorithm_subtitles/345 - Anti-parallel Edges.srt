00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
 Before we dive into algorithms for the max-flow problem,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,000
 let's look at one slight simplification of the input.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,095
 Here's an example flow network.

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,975
 Notice that there are edges from A to B,

5
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:13,450
 and also an edge from B to A.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,035
 These are anti-parallel edges, we'll call them.

7
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,941
 Now, I'd like to remove these anti-parallel edges.

8
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:22,080
 Why we want to remove these anti-parallel edges will become clear

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,510
 later when we come up with our algorithms for the max-flow problem.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,640
 But for now, let's just say,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,730
 we want to simplify the input a little bit.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,470
 So I wanted to find an equivalent flow network,

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,110
 and work with that equivalent flow network,

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,640
 and in that equivalent flow network,

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,930
 I don't have any anti-parallel edges.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,350
 So let's put some capacities on these edges.

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,260
 So here are the edge capacities for this flow network.

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,000
 Now we wanted to find an equivalent flow network,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,125
 and I wanted this flow network to not have any anti-parallel edges.

20
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,995
 I want to remove this anti-parallel edges here,

21
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:54,715
 and I want the max-flow,

22
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:59,005
 and that equivalent network to be the same as the max-flow here.

23
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,395
 This is the new network I want to consider.

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,730
 So I just split this edge from B to A,

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,435
 into a path of length two,

26
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:08,925
 and I added one auxiliary vertex,

27
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:11,160
 and the edge capacity stay the same.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,970
 This single edge had a capacity of three.

29
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,545
 Now it gives both of these edges capacity three,

30
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:19,965
 and notice that these two flow networks are equivalent to each other?

31
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:22,650
 I can easily convert a solution to the max-flow problem on

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:22,650
 one network to the other network and vice versa.
