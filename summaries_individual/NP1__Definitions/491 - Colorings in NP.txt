The k-colorings problem involves assigning colors to vertices in an undirected graph G so adjacent vertices have different colors, with a palette of k colors available. Solution involves either outputting a valid color assignment or returning 'no' if none exists. The problem belongs to the NP class because solutions can be verified quickly: given a k-coloring, one can check each edge to ensure endpoints have different colors in linear time relative to the number of edges. This satisfies the condition for NP, which requires a polynomial-time verification algorithm.
