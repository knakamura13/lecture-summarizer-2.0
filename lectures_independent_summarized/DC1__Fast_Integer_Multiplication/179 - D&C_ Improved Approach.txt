The text outlines a divide and conquer algorithm for multiplying two numbers, X and Y. Initially, X times Y is expressed as a sum involving four sub-products based on left (l) and right (r) partitions of X and Y. The traditional method would compute these four sub-products (x_l*y_l, x_l*y_r, x_r*y_l, x_r*y_r) recursively, leading to an O(n^2) time algorithm. The goal is to reduce the subproblems from four to three, inspired by Gauss's method for complex numbers. By defining cross terms (x_l*y_r + x_r*y_l), they can be computed without calculating each individually. This is achieved by multiplying the sums (x_l+x_r) and (y_l+y_r) and then subtracting the previously calculated recursive products (A = x_l*y_l and B = x_r*y_r) from the result (referred to as C). With these three recursive computations (A, B, and C), they can be combined using the expression 2^n*A + 2^(n/2)*(C - A - B) + B to find X times Y. This improved algorithm has only three subproblems to recursively solve, making it a more efficient approach.
