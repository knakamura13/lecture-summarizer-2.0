Convolution has various applications, notably in filtering where data points are replaced by functions of neighboring points, reducing noise or adding effects. With mean filtering, a data point Yj is replaced by the average of adjacent 2M+1 points, effectively smoothing the dataset. This is achieved by convolving Y with a vector f, representing the neighboring data points. To enhance smoothing, f can be replaced by a Gaussian function, which gives more weight to proximate points, using a normalizing factor Z to ensure the vector sums to one. Beyond this, Gaussian blur is another filter technique, applying a 2D Gaussian filter to blur images. The goal is to understand the process of computing convolution between vectors.
