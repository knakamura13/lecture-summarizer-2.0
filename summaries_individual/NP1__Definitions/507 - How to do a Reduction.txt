To demonstrate a reduction from coloring problems to SAT, the procedure involves using a theoretical polynomial time SAT algorithm as a black box subroutine, employing it to create a polynomial time algorithm for coloring. Input for the coloring problem consists of a graph and a number of colors, which is transformed via a function f into a Boolean formula representing the SAT problem. The SAT solver processes this input and returns either a satisfying assignment or indicates there is no solution. A second transformation, function h, then converts the SAT solution back into a solution for the original coloring problem, establishing that a solution to the transformed SAT input corresponds to a solution for the initial coloring input and vice versa regarding the lack of a solution.
