To demonstrate the NP-completeness of the Independent Sets (IS) problem, two criteria must be met. First, we must establish that IS is within NP by showing solutions can be verified in polynomial time. Second, we need to prove that solving IS in polynomial time would allow all problems in NP to be solved in polynomial time. This involves demonstrating a polynomial time reduction from any problem A in NP to IS, using an algorithm for IS to solve A efficiently. Achieving this for each problem in NP affirms if IS has a polynomial time solution, then all problems in NP do as well.
