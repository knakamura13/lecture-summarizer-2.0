1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,415
 To convert this new image segmentation problem into a max-flow problem,

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,850
 we define the flow network which is the input to our max-flow problem.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,605
 Now, the input to the image segmentation problem is undirected graph.

4
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:14,830
 Now flow network is a directed graph.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,320
 So we have to take this undirected graph and define a directed graph G-prime.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,615
 Now, here's our example input to the image segmentation problem.

7
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:27,210
 This corresponds to a natural undirected graph which is the corresponding directed graph.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,370
 Well, here are the vertices of this graph.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,570
 And instead of putting undirected edges between neighboring pixels,

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,800
 we'll put bi-directional edges.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,375
 So these bi-directional arrows denote edges

12
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,140
 going from this pixel to this pixel and vice versa.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,500
 This pixel back to this pixel.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,830
 So this is the directed graph corresponding to our undirected image.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,500
 So for each edge in our undirected graph,

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,185
 we add an edge from i to j and j to i.

17
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:55,290
 Now, what are the capacities on these edges?

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,555
 Well, we want to keep track of the separation penalties,

19
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:01,105
 so it's natural to put capacities which are the separation penalties.

20
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:03,926
 So both of these edges will get capacity Pij.

21
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:06,710
 Now, that encodes the separation penalties.

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,775
 What do we do with the foreground and background likelihoods?

23
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,150
 Well, we're going to add additional vertex corresponding to

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,150
 the foreground and an additional vertex corresponding to the background.
