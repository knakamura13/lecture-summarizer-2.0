00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
 Let me give you a quick reminder of the formulation of the 3SAT problem.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,615
 So the input to the 3SAT problem is a boolean formula f in

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:13,370
 conjunctive normal form and we use n for the number of variables and m for

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,885
 the number of clauses in the formula f. Now the extra restriction in 3SAT

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:22,940
 as opposed to SAT is that we assume this formula f has the following constraint.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,560
 Each clause has at most three literals.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,950
 Now the output for the 3SAT problem is a satisfying assignment if one exists.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,430
 This is an assignment of true and false to the n variables,

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,510
 so that the formula f evaluates to true.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,510
 Now if there's no satisfying assignment, we simply output-
