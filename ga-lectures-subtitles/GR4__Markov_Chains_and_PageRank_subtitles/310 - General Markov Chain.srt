00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
 >> So how do I define a Markov chain in general?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,290
 In general I'm going to have capital N states,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,760
 and we are going to label these states by 1 through N. So in this example,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,470
 capital N equals four.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,925
 But in general, think of in our applications capital N is going to be huge.

6
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,740
 For instance, when we do PageRank,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,890
 capital N is going to be the number of webpages on the internet.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,230
 The total number of webpages on the internet.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,580
 Now, this weighted directed graph is defined by its adjacency matrix.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,310
 This is the adjacency matrix for this graph where we think of this is vertex, this state.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,245
 Listening to Kishor is state one,

12
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:34,710
 this is state two,

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,280
 playing Starcraft is state three and sleeping is state four.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,410
 So this is the adjacency matrix for this graph,

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,325
 the weighted adjacency matrix.

16
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:43,885
 Now I denote this by P,

17
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:46,845
 and we refer to this as a transition matrix Y,

18
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:50,490
 because the entry P I J corresponds

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,100
 to the probability of transitioning from state I to state J.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,075
 So if I'm at state I at time T,

21
00:00:57,075 --> 00:01:00,270
 the probability I'm in state J at time T plus 1 is

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,725
 exactly the entry P I J. I look at row I and column J.

23
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,545
 For instance, if I'm playing Starcraft at time T,

24
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:14,190
 the probability that I'm checking email at time T plus one is exactly 0.3.

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,045
 Now, the property that you noticed before about P is that each row sums up to one.

26
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:23,070
 The terminology for this is that P is a stochastic matrix.

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,215
 If the columns also sum to one,

28
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:27,145
 then it's called doubly stochastic.

29
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,245
 But for a Markov Chain,

30
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:30,915
 all I know is that the rows sum up to one.

31
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:30,915
 It doesn't necessarily mean that the columns have to sum up to one.
