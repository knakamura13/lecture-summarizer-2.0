00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,435
 Now, let's summarize some important points about this LP-based algorithm.

2
00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:05,115
 It's a very general approach.

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:10,460
 We can take a hard problem and oftentimes we can reduce it to integer linear programming.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,890
 Integer linear programming is very general, very powerful technique.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,700
 So it's very common that we can reduce

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,225
 these NP-hard problems to integer linear programming.

7
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:21,480
 Then we can relax it to a linear programming.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,365
 We just drop this integrality constraint, and then we can solve it.

9
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:27,150
 There are polynomial time solvers,

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,220
 though we can often use simplex algorithm.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,545
 It's often fast. Then we can take this LP solution

12
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,965
 and we can round it into some randomized way as we just did for its SAT.

13
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:42,090
 And this gives us a feasible point for the integer linear program and hopefully,

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,670
 it's a reasonable heuristic for this solution,

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:44,670
 the optimal value of this ILP.
