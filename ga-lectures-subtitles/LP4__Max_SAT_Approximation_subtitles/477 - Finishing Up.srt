1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 Okay, we're almost done. Actually, we really are done.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,710
 We just have to summarize. We're looking at

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,935
 the probability that this clause, Cj, is satisfied.

4
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:10,815
 This is equal to one minus the product over I,

5
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,085
 of one minus Yi^*.

6
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:18,715
 Then we apply the AM-GM inequality to convert this product into a sum.

7
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:25,320
 Then we apply the LP constraint to relate that sum over the Yi's to Zj.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,795
 And then we got this inequality.

9
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:34,040
 We got that this is at least one minus, one minus the Zj^* over K,

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,570
 raise to the k-power.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,155
 Now what we just proved is that this whole thing is at least,

12
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:43,070
 this constant which is a function of K,

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,000
 but independent of Z, one,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,190
 minus the quantity one minus one over K to the K, times ZJ^*.

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,505
 Okay, now let's simplify this a little bit.

16
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:56,580
 If you recall, the Taylor series for E to the -X,

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,725
 it's one minus X,

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,390
 X squared over two,

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,580
 X-cubed over three factorial and a plus-minus, alternating series.

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,050
 Now, what if we want to relate E to the minus X to 1 minus X?

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,075
 Well, the next term is positive.

22
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,385
 So E to the minus X is going to be bigger.

23
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:20,980
 So one minus one over K is at most E to the minus one over K raised to the Kth power.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,830
 We have 1 over E, and then take minus and then we have it, it's at least.

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,510
 So we have this quantity becomes one minus one over E,

26
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,600
 times Zj^*, and that's what we wanted to prove.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,380
 That was the lemma we claimed.

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,905
 And therefore, we have a one minus one over E approximation algorithm.

29
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:37,905
 That completes the analysis of this LP-based algorithm.
