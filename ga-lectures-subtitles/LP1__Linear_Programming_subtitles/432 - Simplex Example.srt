00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,895
 Now here's our earlier example with three variables,

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:06,250
 and let's illustrate the simplex algorithm on this example.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,900
 The feasible region is this three dimensional convex polyhedron.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,910
 How does simplex start?

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,685
 Well, we start at the point (0, 0,

6
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:16,530
 0), and we can check that this point is feasible,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,390
 it satisfies all of the constraints,

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,774
 and the value of the objective function for this point is zero.

9
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:23,710
 So we have profit zero for this point.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,910
 Now, where is this point in the feasible region?

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,504
 It's his point in the back.

12
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:31,184
 Now this point is defined by these three inequalities.

13
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:34,890
 We satisfy these three constraints with equality,

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,060
 and the remaining constraints,

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,200
 the remaining four constraints,

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,549
 we satisfy with inequalities.

17
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,515
 Let's look at a neighboring vertex.

18
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,295
 Let's look at this vertex.

19
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:47,189
 This vertex is defined by this constraint with equality,

20
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,134
 and these two non-negativity constraints but we dropped that one.

21
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,609
 So we're looking at the vertex defined by this first constraint with equality,

22
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,869
 and these last two non-negativity constraints with equality.

23
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:01,664
 This corresponds to this vertex of the feasible region,

24
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:03,613
 and this is the point (300, 0,

25
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,439
 0), and it has profit 300.

26
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,075
 So when we consider it from the zero vector,

27
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,834
 then we're going to move here because it has higher profit.

28
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:15,424
 Next, let's consider this neighboring vertex of the current point.

29
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:17,430
 This new vertex satisfies

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,129
 these first two constraints with equality, and the last constraint.

31
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:25,489
 It corresponds to the point (300, 200, 0).

32
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,599
 And if you plug it into the objective function,

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,412
 it has profit 1500.

34
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,469
 The profit is higher,

35
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:33,245
 so we move to this new point.

36
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:36,424
 Now let's see if there's a neighbor of this new point which is better.

37
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:38,254
 Let's consider this neighbor.

38
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:40,905
 This is at the intersection of these three faces,

39
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,640
 these three faces are the first three constraints.

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,843
 This is the point (300, 200, 50).

41
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:52,049
 The value of the objective function for this point is 2000, so we move there.

42
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,750
 From the current point, let's try a new neighbor.

43
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,864
 Consider this neighboring vertex,

44
00:01:56,864 --> 00:02:00,968
 this vertex is defined by equality by these three constraints,

45
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:02,879
 and it satisfies the other constraints,

46
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,844
 so it lies in the feasible region.

47
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:07,885
 It corresponds to the point (200, 200, 100).

48
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:11,610
 You can see that because X_2 = 200.

49
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,930
 And then once X_2 = 200,

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,099
 and this constraint says that X3 = 100.

51
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,849
 And then finally, this specifies that X1 = 200.

52
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,479
 And then if you check the value of the objective function,

53
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,629
 we get that it's 2400,

54
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,460
 so we move to this new point.

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,914
 Finally, we check all of the neighbors of this vertex,

56
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,534
 and we see that all of the neighbors are worse.

57
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:33,534
 So we know that we're at the optimal point and we successfully solved this LP.
