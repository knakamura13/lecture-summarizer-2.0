Inserting an element X into a dictionary of unacceptable passwords involves computing two hash values, H1(X) and H2(X). The element is then added to the less loaded of the two corresponding linked lists, with loads denoting list sizes, and the chosen list's size is incremented. An insertion operates in constant O(1) time. To query if an element Y, a proposed password, is unacceptable, the same hash functions determine its potential locations. Both linked lists for H1(Y) and H2(Y) are checked; if Y is present in either, it is in the dictionary. Query time depends on the load of these bins and is bound by twice the maximum load. With equal dictionary and hash table sizes (M = N), query times reduce significantly from O(log N) to O(log log N) when using two hash functions. Although in practice, pseudo-random hash functions from libraries replace truly random ones, theoretical analysis assumes truly random for simplicity, leading to an O(log log N) maximum load with two-choice insertion. This method improves efficiency with no additional space cost but does leave unanswered questions about maintaining truly random hash functions in practice.
