The program P in C uses a single input X, with a while loop checking if X is odd (X mod two equals one). If X is odd, it adds six to X and repeats indefinitely. With the initial value of X equal to five, the program enters an infinite loop because X remains odd (5, 11, 17, 23, ...), thus never halting. Assuming infinite memory prevents overflow, halting of P with X equals five is false, as P on this input does not terminate.
