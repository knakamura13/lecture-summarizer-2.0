Constructing a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for shortest paths in a graph requires a different approach than the Bellman-Ford algorithm's edge count conditioning. Instead, we consider a prefix of vertices as an input condition, ordering vertices from one to n, and using them as a basis for our DP approach. This method involves creating a three-dimensional DP table D, indexed by i (the prefix cut-off for vertex set), s (the start vertex), and t (the end vertex). The value D(i, s, t) represents the shortest path length from s to t using only vertices 1 through i as intermediates. We iterate over all vertices pairs for s and t and all prefixes i from 0 (empty set) to n (all vertices) to fill in this table. When i = n, D(n, s, t) indicates the shortest path from s to t over the entire graph. The next step involves developing a recurrence to efficiently compute this DP table.
