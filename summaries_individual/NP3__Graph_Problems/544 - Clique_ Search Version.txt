The Clique problem involves finding a subset of vertices S in an undirected graph G that forms a clique of at least size g, aiming for the largest possible clique. Unlike a trivial task of finding at most g size (where an empty set could suffice), the challenge is to determine if such a clique exists; if it does, output the clique, if not, output NO. The focus is on proving the Clique problem's NP-completeness.
