1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 Let's first prove that the existence of a saturating flow

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,690
 G prime implies the existence of a feasible flow

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,150
 in G. So what we're going to do is we're going to take

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,300
 a saturating flow F prime in this graph G prime that we constructed,

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,070
 and we're going to use that to construct the feasible flow F in

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,330
 the original flow network G. Now the construction is quite straightforward.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,105
 Recall that the capacities in G prime,

8
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:25,965
 where the capacities in G,

9
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,040
 shifted by the demand D. So,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,515
 we're going to let the flow in G be equal to the flow in G prime, plus the demand.

11
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:38,325
 So if we had zero flow in G prime,

12
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:41,280
 then we'll have the minimum flow possible in G,

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,280
 which is the demand D of E. And if we send,

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,990
 say two units of flow in G prime along this edge E,

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,285
 then will send two plus the demand along

16
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:55,560
 the edge E in the graph G. Now there's two things we need to check.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,020
 We need to check that F is a valid flow.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,870
 So for all the internal vertices in this graph G,

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,285
 the flow in has to equal the flow out, and to be valid,

20
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:07,520
 we need that to flow along an edge is in most the capacity,

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,060
 and additionally, we need to check that F is a feasible flow.

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,875
 That means it satisfies all the demand constraints.

23
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,870
 Let's start with the second condition.

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,130
 Let's check that F is a feasible flow.

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,925
 Now F prime is a flow.

26
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:22,570
 What does that mean for the flow along a particular edge E?

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,440
 It's got to be non-negative.

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,765
 So what does that imply about this flow F that we just constructed?

29
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:31,205
 Well then the flow F along the edge E is

30
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:35,490
 at least D of E. Zero flow corresponds to D of E flow,

31
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,740
 and since the flow is now-negative,

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,490
 that means these flows F satisfy the demand constraints,

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,795
 so F is feasible.

34
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:45,360
 While we're at it, let's look at the capacity constraints,

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,145
 the upper bound on these flows.

36
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:53,068
 We know this flow is at most C prime E along the edge E. That implies that the flow F

37
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:59,205
 along this edge E is at most C prime of E plus demand E. Recall,

38
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:04,890
 C prime of E was defined as C of E minus the demand long E. Therefore,

39
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,580
 this quantity equals the capacity along the edge in the original network

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,300
 G. So this flow F that we constructed,

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,205
 satisfies demand constraints and satisfies the capacity constraints.

42
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:16,205
 So all that remains is to check that the flow in to every vertex equals the flow out.
