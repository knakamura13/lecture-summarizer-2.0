Hashing, specifically bloom filters, discussed. Starts with "balls into bins" example for hashing intuition. Analyses probabilistic aspects, revealing the "power of two choices" concept guiding advanced hashing designs. Post-toy problem, explores chain hashing, then delves into sophisticated bloom filters.
