1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,175
 Now how did this apply for Kruskal's algorithm?

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:05,325
 For Kruskal's algorithm we said this edge e star was between

3
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:09,105
 vertices v and w. We added this edge e star,

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,835
 if the component containing v,

5
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,710
 one of the endpoints was not the same as a component containing

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,280
 w. So v and w were not connected in the current subgraph.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,410
 So what was the set s in this example?

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,590
 To set s in this example was the component containing v

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,710
 or the component containing w. Let's just say that s was

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,240
 a component containing v and therefore since the component is a maximal set of

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
 connective vertices we know that there is no edge in

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,060
 the partial solution which crosses from s to s bar.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,520
 And then since we consider the edges in increasing order, in sorted order,

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,320
 then we know that e-star must be

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,360
 the minimum weight edge crossing from this component to outside.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,770
 So this edge e star or that Kruskal's algorithm

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,875
 considers is satisfies the hypothesis of the Lemma.

18
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:58,500
 So if we add an e star to our partial solution we'll still be on our way to an MST.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,875
 So this proves correctness of Kruskal's algorithm.

20
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,675
 So Kruskal's algorithm uses a particular type of set s,

21
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:07,530
 but this is true in general for any cut s. Now it's important

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,575
 to understand the statement of the cut property and also to understand the proof.

23
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:14,850
 The statement, the main idea is that any edge which is

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,825
 minimum weight across a cut is going to be part of some MST.

25
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,230
 Why? Because if you give me a tree T which does not contain

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,320
 this minimum weight edge across the cut then I can

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,230
 add this edge into the current tree

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,845
 and I can construct a new tree which is of smaller weight.

29
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:33,265
 Actually, to be precise,

30
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,465
 I'm not necessarily going to construct a new tree with a smaller weight,

31
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:40,130
 but if you give me a tree T which does not contain this edge e star,

32
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,691
 or construct a new tree,

33
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,220
 T prime where the weight of T prime is

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,850
 at most the weight of T. So the weight doesn't increase.

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,975
 And that's going to be the intuition for the proof.

36
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,545
 We're going to take this tree T,

37
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:56,310
 we don't know this tree T but we know there exists an MST T which contains X,

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,035
 our partial solution so far.

39
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,080
 And now we're going to add this edge e star into X.

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:08,335
 If this MST T contains X unit e star then we're all done.

41
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,130
 Now there's no reason why this edge e star has to be in

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,750
 this tree T. So what happens if edge e star is not in the tree T?

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,381
 Well then we're going to construct a new tree,

44
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:21,795
 T Prime, where the weight of T prime is at most the weight of T,

45
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:28,508
 and in this tree T prime will be the edge e star and also X,

46
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:31,395
 and we'll construct this tree T prime by modifying

47
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:36,210
 the tree T slightly by adding in the edge e star and then removing an edge,

48
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,170
 in order to construct a new tree.

49
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,170
 So let's go ahead and dive into the proof of the cut property.
