Two strongly connected components (SCCs), S and S', are considered where S has a vertex V and S' has a vertex W, with an edge from V to W. The claim is that the maximum post-order number in S is greater than in S'. Due to the absence of cycles between SCCs, no path exists from S' to S. In proving the claim, a depth-first search (DFS) assigns post-order numbers to vertices. The first visited vertex, Z, from S union S' determines the proof's direction. If Z is in S', then all of S' is explored and assigned post-order numbers before any vertex in S is visited. Hence, all post-order numbers in S' are smaller than any in S. In the case where Z is in S, it is the root of the DFS subtree containing all vertices of S union S', and as the last to finish, it has the maximum post-order number in S union S'. Therefore, Z, in S, confirms the maximum post-order number in S is greater than any in S'. This result proves the claim and validates the SCC algorithm, showing a vertex with the highest post-order number belongs to a source SCC, allowing for the computation and topological sorting of SCCs with two DFS runs.
