Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms are designed based on the recursive nature of problems but are implemented without actual recursion to enhance performance and simplify runtime analysis. In contrast, memoization employs hash tables to remember solved sub-problems, which we avoid in this course to focus on pure DP techniques and avoid confusion. While some prefer memoization for its elegance, DP is acclaimed for its efficiency, reduced overhead, and simpler runtime analysis. Mastery of DP requires ample practice, as initially, it appears complex to students. Repetitive exercises in and out of class—from textbooks and online resources—are essential for students to internalize the DP approach, eventually finding it intuitive and straightforward to devise DP solutions. Consistent practice is emphasized as the key to excelling in the subject.
