Program harmful either terminates or loops infinitely when given its own code as input. If harmful terminates when receiving itself, it should also loop infinitely (contradiction). Conversely, if it loops infinitely with itself as input, it should terminate (another contradiction). As both scenarios are impossible and lead to contradictions, it proves no program (a "terminator") can universally solve the halting problem, confirming the theorem that such a universal solution doesn't exist.
