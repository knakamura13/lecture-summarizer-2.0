00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,405
 Let's take a look at BFS on one of our earlier examples.

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:05,970
 Here's one of our examples of a flow network.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,995
 Let's assume that we're at the initial flow.

4
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:11,025
 So the flow is zero along every edge of the graph.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,898
 Therefore, the capacities along these edges don't really matter.

6
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:15,870
 Now, since the flow is zero along every edge,

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,110
 there's no back edges,

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,720
 and the residual network at this stage will be exactly the same flow network.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,580
 Now, let's run BFS on this residual network.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,580
 Now, we start off from vertex s,

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,930
 and we explore the edges out of s,

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,890
 and we see a, b and c. Next,

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,435
 we explore the edges out of a,

14
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,760
 b and c. From vertex a,

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,180
 we see d and e. From vertex b,

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,535
 we see e, which is already explored.

17
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:42,255
 So this is an unexplored edge.

18
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:47,370
 Then from vertex c, we see vertex f. So the solid red edges are the tree edges,

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,810
 the BFS tree edges,

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,650
 and the dash gray edges are the non-explored edges.

21
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,650
 Now we explore the edges out of d,

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,410
 e and f. From vertex d we see vertex t,

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,065
 our end vertex, and then we have a bunch of unexplored edges.

24
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,110
 Now at this stage, BFS is done.

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,918
 Now, let's look at some properties of BFS.

26
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,695
 Notice this is exploring the graph in layers.

27
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:12,410
 Now, in the first layer or level is only vertex s itself.

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,050
 So this is at level 0.

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,815
 Now then, the neighbors of s are at level 1.

30
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,175
 So a, b and c are level 1.

31
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:20,825
 Then we have that d, e,

32
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,260
 f are at level 2.

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,075
 And finally, vertex t is at level 3.

34
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,180
 Now the level of vertex is the same as

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,150
 the minimum number of edges to go from s to that vertex.

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,540
 So formerly, the level of vertex is the same as the distance.

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,040
 Now, what is the path cal-P that BFS finds from s to t?

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,430
 Well, it's this path, s to a to d to t.

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,275
 Notice on this path from s to t, look at the levels.

40
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,730
 S is at level zero, a is at level 1,

41
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,230
 d is at level 2,

42
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,730
 and t is at level 3.

43
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,815
 So the level goes up by plus 1 at every edge.

44
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:57,135
 Now, notice that the level cannot go up by more than one in one edge,

45
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:58,945
 because of the definition of the level.

46
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,810
 It's the minimum number of edges from s to that vertex.

47
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,585
 Similarly, the level cannot stay the same or go down along an edge.

48
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,703
 Otherwise, there's a shorter path to the vertex.

49
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:12,090
 So the path that BFS finds from s to t,

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,230
 is going to be a path where the level goes up by plus one at every edge.

51
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,795
 That's the key property that we need from BFS,

52
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,220
 that the path obtained from s to t,

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,220
 the levels of the vertices go up by plus 1 along every edge of their path.
