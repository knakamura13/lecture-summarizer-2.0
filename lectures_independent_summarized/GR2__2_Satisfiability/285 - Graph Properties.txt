A two-SAT problem was analyzed through graph representation, where vertices represent literals and edges signify implications. A crucial observation was that a path from a literal X_i to its negation X_i-bar implies the literal can't be true without contradiction. If X_i is set to true, it leads to setting X_i to false, creating a contradiction, which rules out a true assignment for X_i. Conversely, no implications rise from setting X_i to false if there's no path from X_i-bar. The unsatisfiability becomes clear if there's a path from X_i to X_i-bar and back from X_i-bar to X_i; neither true nor false can be assigned to X_i without leading to a contradiction. This condition translates to X_i and X_i-bar being in the same strongly connected component (SCC) in the graph. Whenever a variable and its negation are in the same SCC, the formula cannot be satisfied. In contrast, if each variable and its negation belong to separate SCCs, a satisfying assignment exists, and the formula is satisfiable. The graph properties are therefore pivotal in determining the satisfiability of a two-SAT Boolean formula.
