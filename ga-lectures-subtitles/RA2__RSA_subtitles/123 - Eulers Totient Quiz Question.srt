1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,865
 Now here's Euler's theorem again.

2
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:05,720
 Let's look at this Euler's totient function for the case that we're going to use.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,290
 We're going to have a pair of prime numbers P and Q.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,485
 So we saw when N equals one prime number P,

5
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:16,100
 then Euler's theorem is the same as Fermat's little theorem.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,765
 We're going to apply Euler's theorem for the case when

7
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,020
 capital N is the product of P and Q,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,865
 where P and Q are both prime numbers.

9
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,180
 What is phi of N in this case?

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,930
 Why not go ahead and try to figure out what is phi of N for

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,350
 the case when N is P times Q for prime numbers P and Q.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,520
 So we want to figure out how many numbers between 1 and P times

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,520
 Q are relatively prime to PQ.
