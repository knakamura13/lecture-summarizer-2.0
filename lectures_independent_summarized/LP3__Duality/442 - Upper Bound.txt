Studying a specific 3D point (200,200,100) in a linear programming (LP) issue with profit as the objective function, valued at 2,400, intent on confirming its optimality for the highest profit. Examined a 4D vector Y (0,1/3,1,8/3) corresponding to LP's four constraints. Taking feasible points that satisfy constraints, we considered the linear combination of constraints multiplied by respective elements of Y, yielding a new inequality expression. Simplified this expression, consolidating terms associated with variables X1, X2, and X3. Substituting vector Y into the simplified expression gave coefficients for X1, X2, and X3, which, when multiplied by their respective variable values, equaled 2,400â€”the value of the original LP's objective at the investigated point. Concluded that since all feasible solutions to the LP can't surpass 2,400 in value and we have a point achieving this profit, this point must be the optimal solution, confirming its status as yielding the maximum profit possible in this LP.
