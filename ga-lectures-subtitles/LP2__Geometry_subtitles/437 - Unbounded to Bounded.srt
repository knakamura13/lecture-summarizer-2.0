1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
 So here, again, is the feasible region for

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,260
 this LP and let's change this objective function.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,310
 Let's maximize 2x-3y.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,120
 Let's look at the level sets for this objective function in this feasible region.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,210
 Here's the feasible region once again with the heat map and the level set's mark.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,640
 So if we look at this line, 2x-3y=c,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,465
 we achieve c=-12 on this line,

8
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:27,445
 and then it increases as we go down.

9
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,060
 So the optimal value of this LP is going to be

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,460
 achieved at this vertex of the feasible region.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,140
 So this maximization is defined for this objective function,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,400
 whereas for the other objective function,

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,920
 the maximization was undefined.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,695
 So whether an LP is feasible or infeasible simply depends on the constraints,

15
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:46,695
 whether an LP is bounded or unbounded depends on the objective function.
