NP-complete problems are the most challenging within the NP class, implying if one such problem is solved in polynomial time, all NP class problems could be solved similarly. However, it's improbable to find such a solution since if P ≠ NP, no algorithm can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time for every input. Undecidable problems, a separate class, lack a solution on all inputs regardless of the algorithm’s runtime. Alan Turing's 1936 work established the halting problem as undecidable, using what is now known as a Turing Machine, which models the capabilities of conventional computers—excluding quantum computers. Turing’s proof was foundational, leading the way to identifying further undecidable problems.
