Algorithm finds strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph using two DFS runs—one on the original graph and one on its reverse. Initially, run DFS in the reverse graph to determine post-order numbering. The vertex with the highest post-order number indicates a source SCC in the reverse graph, which corresponds to a sink SCC in the original graph. Starting DFS from this vertex allows us to identify and “rip out” the entire SCC, label it, and reduce the graph. We then select the next vertex with the highest post-order number from the remaining graph and repeat the process. By doing this, we sequentially identify and label all SCCs, with DFS continuing from vertices with decreasing post-order numbers. The result is SCCs labeled in reverse topological order, providing structure to the components. This dual-DFS approach generalizes to any directed graph for efficient SCC identification and topological structuring.
