Exploring computational complexity, specifically NP completeness, its meaning, and how to prove a problem is NP complete. Addressing P vs. NP question, unpacking its significance, and examining problem intractability â€“ efficiently solvable problems implying polynomial time relation to input size versus intractable ones. Methodology includes proving NP completeness to demonstrate intractability. Further investigation into P and NP definitions follows.
