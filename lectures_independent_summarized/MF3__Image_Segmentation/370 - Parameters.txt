In the context of an undirected graph G representing pixels, each pixel is associated with two non-negative parameters: fi, representing the likelihood of the pixel being in the foreground, and bi, denoting background likelihood. Additionally, for each pair of neighboring pixels, a non-negative separation penalty pij is defined, representing the cost of classifying the pixels into different objects.
