1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
 Here are the key conclusions that we need from this analysis.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,665
 If we add an edge from vertex y to vertex z to the residual network,

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,230
 then what can we conclude?

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,740
 Well that's this case, and this case.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,260
 Notice that in both of these cases,

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,205
 the opposite direction edge is always on the augmenting path.

7
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:20,715
 So if we add this edge from y to z to the residual network,

8
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:24,720
 then we know that the edge from z to y is on the augmenting path.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,680
 Similarly, if we remove the edge from y to z from the residual graph,

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,670
 then what can we conclude in this case?

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,885
 Well, when we remove,

12
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:35,550
 then we notice that the edge itself is on the augmenting path.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,610
 So in this case, we know that the edge from y to z is on the augmenting path.

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,945
 So if we add an edge y to z to the residual graph,

15
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:46,000
 then the opposite direction edge is on the augmenting path.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
 If we remove an edge,

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,860
 then the edge itself is on the augmenting path.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,210
 This should make intuitive sense,

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,625
 because to remove an edge from the residual graph,

20
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,415
 that means we remove the leftover capacity.

21
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:59,265
 In order to remove the leftover capacity,

22
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,995
 that means we have to increase the flow along this edge.

23
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,865
 To increase the flow along the edge,

24
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:07,640
 the edge has to be on the augmenting path in order to augment along it.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,570
 To add an edge to the residual network,

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,647
 we have to increase the spare capacity.

27
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:14,310
 That means we have to decrease the flow along this edge.

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,175
 To decrease the flow along an edge,

29
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,795
 then the reverse direction edge must be augmented.

30
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:19,795
 So it must be on the augmenting path.
