1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,285
 And what we just saw are

2
00:00:01,285 --> 00:00:05,160
 that the nth roots of unity correspond to the points in polar coordinates

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,010
 1 comma 2pi over n times j. j equals 0 corresponds to this point which is 1.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,240
 Then we take step sizes of angle theta, where theta equals 2pi over n,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,660
 this gives us j equals 1 comma j equals 2 and so on and we

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,385
 keep taking the equal size steps around the unit circle.

7
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:24,540
 Let's introduce a little bit of notation to make it more

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,535
 convenient for expressing these nth roots of unity.

9
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:32,780
 So let's let omega sub n denote the point corresponding to j was 1.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,920
 So it's this 1 right here so this is

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,970
 omega sub n. Now what is the next point correspond to?

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,705
 Well, we just doubled the angle so it's just a square of this point

13
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:46,676
 omega sub n. And the next one is going to be the cube of this point.

14
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:50,810
 And the jth point is going to be the jth power.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,250
 So the last one is going to be omega sub n to

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,080
 the n minus 1th power and then we have omega sub n to the nth power,

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,395
 which is the same as omega sub n to the zero power which is the number 1.

18
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:06,485
 So the nth roots of unity are the following n numbers,

19
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:08,790
 it's omega sub n to the zero power,

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,930
 to the 1th Power,

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,185
 to the square, to the n minus 1 power.

22
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:18,260
 These n numbers in polar coordinates are 1 comma 2pi over n times j,

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,385
 where j varies from 0 to n minus 1.

24
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,382
 And recall Euler's formula,

25
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:27,390
 so this number omega sub n equals e raised to

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,195
 the power 2pi i over n so the jth of the nth roots of unity,

27
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:35,940
 omega sub n raised to the jth power,

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,565
 where j varies between 0 and n minus 1,

29
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:38,565
 is e raised to the power 2pi i times j over n.
