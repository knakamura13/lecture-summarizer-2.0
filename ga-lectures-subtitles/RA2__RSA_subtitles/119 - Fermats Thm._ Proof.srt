00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,205
 So, here's Fermet's little theorem again.

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:07,260
 For prime number p, for every z between one and p minus one,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,620
 if we look at z raised to the power of p minus one and take in mod p we end up with one.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,776
 So well let's look at the proof of this theorem.

5
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:18,335
 Let me look at the set of possible z's. What are these?

6
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:21,120
 These are all the numbers between one and p minus one.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,555
 One, two, three up to p minus one.

8
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:26,700
 Let's define the set s as the possible z's.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,930
 So, these are the numbers one,

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,815
 two, three up to p minus one.

11
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:34,090
 Which is defined in this set s. Now let's look at another set s prime.

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,205
 S Prime is going to be defined by taking the elements of s,

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,260
 each of these p minus one elements,

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,585
 multiplying each one by z.

15
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,570
 So we got z times s and then for each of

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,145
 those elements we take it mod p. So the first element is going to be one time z

17
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:55,660
 mod p. The second element is going to be two times z mod p.

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,570
 The last element is going to be p minus

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,225
 one times z mod p. Let's look at a simple example.

20
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:04,465
 Let's take p as seven and let's take z as four.

21
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,270
 First off, what's the set S?

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,430
 S there are the numbers one, two, three,

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,910
 four, five, six.

24
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,340
 What's S prime?

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,590
 Well, the first element is one times four which is

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,770
 four mod seven, which is going to be four.

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,965
 The second element is going to be two times four which is eight mod seven which is one.

28
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:26,070
 The third element is going to be three times four which is 12 mod seven which is

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,510
 five and four times four is 16 mod seven is two.

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,030
 Five times four is 20 mod seven is six.

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,500
 Finally six times four is 24 mod seven is three. Look at this set.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,555
 It's the same as s except in different order.

33
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:47,130
 So the set of elements are the same just it's a permutation of

34
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,285
 s. So the key thing is that s and s prime are the same sets,

35
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,710
 just in different order.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,390
 Let me prove to you this fact,

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,890
 that in general s and s prime are the same sets and then we're going to use

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:58,890
 this fact that s and s prime are the same sets to prove the Fermet's little Theorem.
