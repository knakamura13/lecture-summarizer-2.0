1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,025
 Let's take a look at another example before

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,770
 giving the general formulation of linear programming.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,760
 Now this will be a slight twist on the previous example.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,435
 Now we have three products A,

5
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:12,515
 B and C. We'll look at the profit obtained from each,

6
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:13,830
 the demand for each,

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,942
 the supply just as before and we'll add one additional constraint compared to before,

8
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:21,880
 this will be a packaging constraint.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,065
 We'll say the profit is one dollar for each unit of A that we sell,

10
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:29,005
 six dollars for each unit of B and ten dollars for C.

11
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:33,000
 The demand is at most 300 units per day for A and at most

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,360
 200 units per day for B and unlimited demand for

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,280
 C. The supply that we can produce is at most 1000 hours per day.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,350
 Each unit of A takes one hour,

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,320
 each unit of B takes three hours to produce and

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,830
 each unit of C takes two hours to produce, finally the packaging.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,345
 Now we can produce at most 500 units in total per day.

18
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,010
 We'll say that A doesn't require any packaging,

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,010
 B uses one unit of packaging per unit and C takes three units of the packaging per unit.
