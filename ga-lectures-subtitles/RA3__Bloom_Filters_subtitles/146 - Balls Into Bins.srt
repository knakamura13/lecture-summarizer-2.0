1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
 For this toy problem,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,370
 we have n balls,

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,930
 which are identical to each other,

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,145
 and we have n bins,

5
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:08,880
 which we'll label B1, B2, up through Bn.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,020
 Each ball is thrown into a random bin,

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,070
 and this is done independent of the other bins.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,690
 Now, what we're going to do for this toy problem,

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,925
 is we're going to throw each ball into a random bin.

10
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:24,040
 Now, the process for each ball is independent of what happened for the other balls.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,720
 We want to look at the number of balls that are assigned to each bin.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,585
 Therefore, we look at the random variable load_of_i,

13
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:33,795
 which is the number of balls assigned to bin i.

14
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,100
 What we're interested in is the maximum load.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,350
 This is the maximum number of balls in any particular bin.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,335
 In other words, the max load is the max_over_i of the load of bin i.

17
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:47,520
 How large can the max load get?

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,365
 Well, in the worst case,

19
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:52,620
 all of the balls might get assigned to the same bin.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,510
 But, what's the chance of that? It's quite small.

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,235
 I mean, what's the chance of all n balls being assigned to bin B1, let's say.

22
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:04,060
 The probability of one particular ball being assigned to bin B1 is one_over_n.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,840
 What's the chance that all n balls get assigned to this particular bin?

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,140
 It's one_over_n_to_the_n.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,600
 This is really tiny,

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,120
 so this is very unlikely.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,995
 In the worst case, the max load could be n because of such a scenario.

28
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,055
 But what is the typical scenario?

29
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,240
 How large is the max load typically?

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,130
 That's what we want to analyze now.

31
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,185
 We want to make a statement such as,

32
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,975
 with high probability, the max load is,

33
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:32,120
 some quantity, such as square root n,

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,510
 log n, order one.

35
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:34,510
 So, let's dive in and see what the max load is in a typical scenario.
