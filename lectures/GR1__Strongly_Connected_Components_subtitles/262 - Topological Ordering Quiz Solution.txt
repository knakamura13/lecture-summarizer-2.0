Now here is one valid topological ordering, X, then Y, then Z, then U, then W. Notice that all the edges go left to right. Now how many valid topological orderings are there? Well, I can move U to any of these last three positions. So there are three choices for the position of U. After I specify the position for U, then the position for Z and W are forced because Z has to come before W. So this graph has three topological.
