1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
 Let's take a look now, at the case when the last characters are different.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,040
 This the situation in our original example,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,010
 Xi is not equal to Yi, A is not equal to B.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,650
 Now in this case, when Xi is not equal to Yi,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,690
 the last character of the longest common subsequence can either be A or B,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,030
 or neither. Certainly, cannot be both.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,370
 Now suppose it's A. For example,

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,225
 suppose this is the last character in The Long common subsequence.

9
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,640
 And what we know about Yi B,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,985
 for B has nothing left to match with an X.

11
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:37,160
 Therefore, we know the LCS does not include B Yi.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,800
 Similarly, if the last character is B says match with this B.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,931
 Then the LCS cannot include A,

14
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,460
 because it has nothing left to match within Y.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,165
 The key point is that the longest common subsequence for this prefix of length i,

16
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:57,770
 either does not include Xi or it does not include Yi or both.

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,310
 So either Xi is dropped or Yi is dropped or both of them are dropped.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,050
 Now let's consider the three cases.

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,940
 If both of them are dropped,

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,715
 then we can simply take the longest common subsequence in this prefix of L(i-1).

21
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:14,395
 So it's similar to the equal case except we don't get this plus one here.

22
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:16,830
 Now what happens if just Xi is dropped?.

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,740
 Well then we have a prefix of L(i-1) in X and a prefix of L(i) in Y.

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,410
 So we have no way of looking this up in our table.

25
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,200
 The solution to this sub problem is not in our table,

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,625
 because the prefixes are of different length in X and Y.

27
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:36,450
 And notice, even if we knew how Yi is matched up with an X, for instance,

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,880
 if we knew this B was match with this B,

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,780
 then we have a prefix of Length 3 and X and we have a prefix of length 6 and y.

30
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,415
 So there's still a different length.

31
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,550
 And similarly, if Yi is not included,

32
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,870
 So we dropped this last character from Y then we have prefix of

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,980
 length 7 in X and a prefix of length 6 in Y.

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,010
 So the prefixes are of different length in X and Y.

35
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,920
 And once again, the solution to this sub problem is not

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,310
 in our table because these prefixes are on a different length.

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,440
 So for this case where where Yi is dropped,

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,040
 we need to look up the longest common subsequence in

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,035
 the prefix of L(i) in X with the prefix of L(i-1) in Y.

40
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:21,500
 Now this isn't in our table presently and similarly when we try to solve this problem,

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,390
 well then we might chop off the last character from

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,940
 Y and then we get even shorter prefixes in length Y.

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,120
 So for this sub problem definition,

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,385
 we are unable to define a recurrence.

45
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:36,315
 We are unable to express L(i) in terms of smaller sub problems,

46
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:39,585
 but we got some insight about what is a valid.

47
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:41,940
 What is a good sub problem definition.

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,410
 The difficulty here was that the prefixes are of the same length for x and y,

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,930
 but we need to allow them to be of different lengths.

50
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,430
 So how do we achieve that?.

51
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,740
 We're going to change from a single parameter i to a pair of parameters i and j. I

52
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,000
 will correspond to the length of

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,605
 the prefix X and j will correspond to the length of the prefix Y.

54
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:04,455
 And, our table will now be a two dimensional table.

55
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:08,250
 So L(i) J will be the length of the longest common subsequence in

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,330
 X1 through Xi with Y1 through Yj.

57
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,330
 And then, we're going to try all possibilities for i and j.
