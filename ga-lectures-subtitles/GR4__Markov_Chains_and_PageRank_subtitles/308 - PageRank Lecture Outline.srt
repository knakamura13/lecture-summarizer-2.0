00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,295
 In this lecture, we're going to look at the PageRank algorithm.

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,870
 This is an algorithm for assigning the importance of a webpage.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,000
 Now, what exactly do we mean by importance?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,880
 Well, this is a subjective term,

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,045
 but we're going to give a precise quantitative interpretation of importance.

6
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,850
 Now, the PageRank algorithm is the algorithm devised by

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,330
 Brin and Page which is at the heart of Google search engine.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,270
 Now, the PageRank algorithm itself is fairly simple,

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,370
 but to fully understand the algorithm,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,800
 we have to first understand some basic mathematical tools known as Markov chains.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,225
 Now, I'm going to give you a quick primer on Markov chains.

12
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,135
 What exactly are Markov chains?

13
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,810
 And what are the key properties of Markov chain?

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,890
 Now, the PageRank algorithm is itself

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,715
 a Markov chain but Markov chain is come up quite often.

16
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:47,585
 For example, you may have heard of the term MCMC,

17
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:50,050
 That stands for Markov chain Monte Carlo.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,125
 Also, you may have heard of simulated annealing,

19
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,570
 which is another example of a Markov chain.

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,090
 Now, we're not going to look at these two examples in detail,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,815
 but if you understand Markov chain,

22
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,315
 the basics of Markov chains,

23
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,440
 then that'll help you understand

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,450
 these more sophisticated concepts if you decide to delve into them in more detail.

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,455
 Now, the key concept for Markov chain is the notion of a stationary distribution.

26
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:12,450
 So, I'm going to spend some time explaining to you what

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,820
 exactly does a stationary distribution mean.

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,760
 How do we determine what the stationary distribution are and what are

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,620
 the important properties of a Markov chain which

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,290
 connect to the notion of a stationary distribution?

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,665
 Finally, once we understand Markov chains and stationary distributions for Markov chains,

32
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:28,680
 then we will be able to fully appreciate

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,080
 the PageRank algorithm and the design choices in the design of the PageRank algorithm.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,060
 Now, let's go ahead and dive into a Markov chain and look

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,060
 at a specific example of a Markov chain.
