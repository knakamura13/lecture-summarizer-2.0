1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,775
 In this example, we'll have four variables which we'll label X,

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:05,525
 Y, W, and Z.

3
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:08,275
 Now, our three-set input is the following formula.

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,960
 X-bar or Y or Z-bar,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,295
 that's the first clause.

6
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:19,620
 Second clause is X or Y-bar or W. The third clause is X-bar or W-bar.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,635
 Fourth clause is Y-bar or Z or W. Now,

8
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:26,555
 to start a construction of the graph, for each clause,

9
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:30,530
 we construct a vertex corresponding to each of the literals.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,145
 So for this clause, we have three vertices

11
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:37,195
 corresponding to the literals X-bar, Y, and Z-bar.

12
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:40,140
 We have three vertices corresponding to this clause,

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,040
 two vertices for this clause,

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,080
 three vertices for this clause.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
 Now we add the clause edges.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,570
 So we add a triangle on these three vertices,

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,375
 a triangle on these three,

18
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,955
 an edge on this pair,

19
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,835
 and a triangle on these three.

20
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:56,065
 Finally, we want to add the variable edges.

21
00:00:56,065 --> 00:01:00,095
 So we run an edge from X to all copies of X-bar.

22
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:03,295
 Similarly, from Y to all copies of Y-bar.

23
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:05,970
 From all copies of W to W-bar.

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,295
 Finally, from Z to Z-bar.

25
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:12,160
 Now let's look at an example independent set of size four in this graph.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,755
 Let's say we take X-bar from this triangle,

27
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:18,994
 Y-bar, W-bar, and Y-bar.

28
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,950
 This independent set corresponds to

29
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,220
 the assignment X equals false because of this literal,

30
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,335
 Y equals false because of this and this literal,

31
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,830
 W equals false because of this literal,

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,710
 and Z has no constraints.

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,630
 And notice that such an assignment satisfies this formula.

34
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,910
 Let's prove that in general,

35
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,535
 that an independent set of size m in this graph

36
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:42,490
 corresponds to a satisfying assignment of this formula,

37
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:42,490
 and a satisfying assignment of this formula corresponds to an independent set of size m.
