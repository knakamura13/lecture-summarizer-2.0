To achieve an order n time algorithm for finding a good pivot, the algorithm utilizes a recursive strategy where the pivot is the median of a subset of size n/5 of the original array A. This selection guarantees that the sub-problems are reduced to a maximum size of three-fourths of the original, with the optimal running time for the algorithm satisfying T(n) â‰¤ T(3/4 n) + T(n/5) + O(n). This fits a recursive pattern that results in overall linear time complexity, O(n). Key to this success is ensuring the subset S is a representative sample of the entire array A; the method for choosing S is critical and initially approached naively, with improvements derived from the lessons of that naive approach's failure.
