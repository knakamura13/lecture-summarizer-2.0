Halting problem undecidable due to inherent contradiction. Hypothetical algorithm 'Terminator' asserts resolution of halting problem for all programs/input pairs. Constructing a specific program Q with input J, we demonstrate that Terminator fails, thus invalidating the assumption of its infallibility. Utilization of Terminator as a subroutine within Q forms a paradox, leading to contradiction, proving undecidability. Proof employs contradiction methodology, assuming algorithmic solution, then showing inevitable failure for some input, hence no such algorithm exists.
