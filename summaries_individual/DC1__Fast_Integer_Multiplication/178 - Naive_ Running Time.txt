Algorithm's run time analysis reveals partitioning x and y into halves takes O(n) time. Recursively compute A, B, C, D, each n/2 bit pairs, total 4*T(n/2). Computing final product z requires O(n) time for three additions of n bit numbers and shifting for multiplication by powers of 2, hence also O(n). Combination of recursive subsolutions and additional operations results in T(n)= 4*T(n/2) + O(n) running time, which solves to O(n^2), the same as straightforward multiplication. Improvement hinges on reducing four subproblems to three, leveraging Gauss's idea.
