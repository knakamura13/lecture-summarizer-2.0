In a database of size M with a hash table size of CM, where C > 1, the false positive probability in a Bloom filter is approximately .6185^C. This figure is based on an optimal number of hash functions K; however, examples show varying false positive rates when deviating from this optimum. With K=1 and C=10, the false positive rate is .095, and with C=100, it drops significantly to .00995. Optimal K choices yield even lower rates: .0082 for C=10 and an extremely low 1.3 x 10^-21 for C=100, demonstrating an exponential decrease in false positives as C increases. Bloom filters have the advantage of simple maintenance and fast query times but suffer from occasional false positives and challenges with deletion handling, which can be somewhat mitigated by Counting Bloom Filters. The effectiveness of these theoretical approximations will be tested in practical Bloom filter implementations.
