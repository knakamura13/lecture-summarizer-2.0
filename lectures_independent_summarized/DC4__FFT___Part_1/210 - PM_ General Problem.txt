Exploring a computational problem involving the convolution C of two polynomials, A of X and B of X, characterized by their coefficient vectors. The basic approach to calculate C involves determining its coefficients sequentially, with n coefficients overall. Computing each coefficient takes time proportional to its position K due to the sum of K terms, resulting in an algorithm with quadratic time complexity O(n^2) for the entire operation. The objective is to introduce a more efficient method with O(n log n) time complexity to find the product polynomial C of X.
