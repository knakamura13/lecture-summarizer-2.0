Solved img segmentation by mapping it to a max flow problem in a network. Converted img to undirected graph, added source (s) and sink (t) vertices, and turned edges bi-directional for flow network. Defined capacities, ran max flow to get max-size flow f*. Max flow size equals min st-cut capacity per max flow min-cut theorem. Min-capacity cut corresponds to min-weight partition w prime, inverse to original max-weight partition goal w. Hence, finding min w prime yields max w partition, solving img segmentation via max flow.
