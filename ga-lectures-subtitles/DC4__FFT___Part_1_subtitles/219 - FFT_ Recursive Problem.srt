1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,675
 In order to get two endpoints which satisfy the plus minus property,

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,680
 we are going to choose points so that

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,050
 the second N are the opposite of the first endpoints.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,715
 What happens in the next level of the recursion?

5
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:15,460
 Then the points we're considering are the square of these two endpoints.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,660
 So these are the endpoints which are X one square up to

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,150
 XN square and we want these endpoints to also satisfy the plus minus property.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,130
 Let's assume that N is a power of two.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,970
 Then we need that Y one is the opposite of YN over two plus

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,212
 one and up to YN over two is the opposite of YN.

11
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,525
 What does this mean in terms of X?

12
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:42,275
 This means that X one squared is the opposite of XN over two plus one square.

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,085
 But the square of a number is always positive,

14
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,722
 so this is a positive number,

15
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,740
 and this is a positive number.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,700
 So how can they be opposites of each other?

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,495
 Well it's impossible if we're working with real numbers.

18
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:56,820
 The only way to achieve this is by looking at complex numbers,

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,325
 so we can easily achieve the plus minus property at the top level of the recursion.

20
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,750
 But for all further levels of the recursion,

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,100
 in order to achieve the plus minus property we need to look at complex numbers.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,950
 So let's do a quick review of complex numbers and then

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,950
 we'll see the appropriate choice of these two N numbers.
