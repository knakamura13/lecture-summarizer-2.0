Finding connected components in an undirected graph involves running DFS and assigning a component number to each vertex. The pseudocode for DFS starts by taking the graph G in adjacency list representation. It initializes visited vertices as false and iterates through them. If a vertex is unvisited, it marks a new component, increments the counter, and explores from that vertex using the explore subroutine. This process will later be applied to directed graphs without changing the pseudocode.
