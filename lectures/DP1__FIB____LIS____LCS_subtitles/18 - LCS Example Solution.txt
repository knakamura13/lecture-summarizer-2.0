The solution is the substring BCBA, BCB A, which is the length four. Why do we care about it? Well, I mean first off it's a nice example, which illustrates a slightly different flavor of the dynamic programming solution. That's the main motivation here, but also, actually, this simple problem is used in Unix diff. If you want to compare two files, you have this unique script diff, which compares two files and looks at the differences and it does utilizes the longest common subsequence dynamic programming algorithm.
