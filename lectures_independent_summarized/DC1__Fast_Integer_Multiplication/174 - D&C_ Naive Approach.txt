Exploring n-bit integer multiplication using divide and conquer mimics merge sort: split inputs (n is a power of 2 for simplicity) in halves, resolve recursively, then combine. x and y split into x_l/x_r and y_l/y_r (left/right n/2 bits). Demonstrated with binary 182 (1011 0110), split into x_l (1011 or 11) and x_r (0110 or 6), with 182 equaling 11 times 2^4 plus 6. This shows x (or y) as x_l shifted by n/2 (multiplied by 2^(n/2)) plus x_r. The method aims to simplify computations by handling smaller parts sequentially, leaning on the relations between original and half-sized numbers stemming from binary representation and positional value.
