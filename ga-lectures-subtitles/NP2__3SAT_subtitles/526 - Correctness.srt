1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 Let's prove this equivalence and hopefully it seems

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,970
 obvious given what we've shown so far.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,990
 So let's start with the forward implication So let's take an assignment to

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,370
 the original n variables which satisfies the original formula f. Now we

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,695
 want to show that keeping this assignment the same for these original n variables there

6
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:24,545
 is an assignment to the new variables so that this new formula f prime is satisfied.

7
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:27,290
 Now since we're keeping the assignment for these n variables the

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,401
 same and the new variables are as distinct for each new clause.

9
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,250
 Therefore, we can look at it a clause by clause.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,820
 So let's look at clause C in the original formula

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,495
 f. If C has at most three literals then it's obvious.

12
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:45,530
 If C is bigger than size three then we replace C by

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,510
 this sequence of K minus two clauses called C prime.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,620
 Now the key is that C prime uses K minus three new variables.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,500
 These variables only appear in C prime for

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,415
 C. They don't appear in any other sequence of clauses.

17
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:06,430
 So the new variables for C are distinct from the new variables for any other clause.

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,410
 So we can set these variables however you want with respect

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,825
 to C and this won't affect any other clauses.

20
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:17,070
 And what we saw before is that there is an assignment to these K minus

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,850
 three new variables so that this new formulas C prime is satisfied.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,315
 In particular, we took the first literal was satisfied in C,

23
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:29,055
 call it Ai and then we set the first Ai minus

24
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:34,285
 2 new variables to true and the remaining new variables to false.

25
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,020
 And we show that that satisfied C prime.

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,420
 Now let's look at the reversed implication.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,135
 Let's take a satisfying assignment for f prime.

28
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,080
 And we want to ignore the assignment for the new variables and show that

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,100
 this assignment for the original n variable satisfies f. Consider

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,870
 a sequence of clauses corresponding to sum C prime in f. What we saw

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,590
 before is that at least one of the literals in the original clause C must be satisfied.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,760
 If all of these literals in the original clause were set to false then

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,890
 there would be no way to satisfy this sequence of clauses C prime.

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,988
 So therefore we can ignore the setting on

35
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:16,200
 the new variables and just looking at the setting on the original n variables.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,200
 That's going to satisfy each of the clauses in the original formula f.
