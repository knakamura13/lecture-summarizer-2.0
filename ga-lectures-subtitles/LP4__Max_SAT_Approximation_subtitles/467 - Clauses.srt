1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
 We're going to have a constraint for every clause.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:06,295
 Let's take an example clause to get some idea of what we want to achieve.

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:08,550
 Consider this clause X5,

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,910
 or X3, or X6.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,210
 We made all the literals positive in order to make it a simple example.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,335
 Now, what do we want from our constraint?

7
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:20,855
 What we want that if these variables are set to false.

8
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:26,430
 Now, setting X5 to false is going to correspond to setting Y5 to 0,

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,330
 and Y3 to 0.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,430
 And finally, Y6 to 0.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,600
 So if these three variables are set to 0,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,580
 which are going to correspond to setting these variables to false,

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,750
 then this clause is not satisfied,

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,340
 then we want the variable for this clause to be value 0.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,960
 So when this clause,

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,185
 this J clause is not satisfied,

17
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:50,110
 we want these variables ZJ to be constrained to be value 0.

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,580
 What if it's another setting?

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,640
 Well, then this clause is satisfied.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,585
 In this case, ZJ will be value 0 or 1.

21
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,590
 We can't force it to be value 1,

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,065
 but what we can do is we can try to maximize these ZJ's,

23
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,675
 that'll be our objective function,

24
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:06,415
 and then the optimal point will take value 1.

25
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,810
 So if it can achieve value 1, then we will.

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,355
 In summary, the constraint we need to add is that if all three of these variables are 0,

27
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,765
 then ZJ is 0.

28
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,180
 How do we achieve that?

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,055
 We say that ZJ is at most Y5+Y3+Y6.

30
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,315
 So if these three variables are 0,

31
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,335
 then ZJ must be 0.

32
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:28,328
 Now if at least one of these is 1,

33
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:31,200
 then ZJ can takes values 0 or 1.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,405
 Recall that these variables are constrained between 0 and 1,

35
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:34,405
 and also these Y's are constrained to be 0 or 1.
