00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,655
 Here's a key idea for relating independent sets and cliques in a graph.

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:07,115
 Let's compare a clique and independent set.

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:09,930
 A clique is fully connected which means that I have

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,410
 all edges within the pairs of S. In contrast,

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,630
 an independent set has no edges within the set S. For an independent set,

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,910
 for any pair X,Y in S,

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,185
 they are not connected by an edge.

8
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:27,075
 Whereas for clique, for any pair X,Y within S,

9
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:29,066
 they are connected by an edge.

10
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,830
 So they are opposites of each other.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,500
 Clique is opposite of independent set and vice versa.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,760
 Now we're going to have to take an undirected graph where we want to

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,605
 solve the independent set problem on this graph.

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,030
 Now we are assuming that we have an algorithm to solve the clique problem.

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,860
 So we want to transform this input for

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,060
 the independent set problem into an equivalent input for the clique problem.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,135
 What should we do? Well, we should take the opposite of this graph.

18
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,910
 What exactly do we mean by the opposite?

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,635
 Well, let's formalize it now.

20
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:59,060
 We're going to denote the opposite of G as G bar to complement.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,530
 It's going to have the same vertex set and

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,665
 the edges are going to be the complement of the edges here.

23
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:12,075
 So the edges in E bar are those pairs X,Y which are not an edge in E. So in other words,

24
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:16,170
 a pair X,Y is an edge in G bar, if and only if,

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,620
 the pair X,Y is not an edge in E. So it's not an edge in E,

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,125
 then it's an edge in E bar.

27
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,260
 If it is an edge in E,

28
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,965
 then it's not an edge in E bar.

29
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,340
 Now we can formalize this key idea,

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,940
 that clique and independent sets are opposites of each other.

31
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,785
 Now our observation is that S is an independent set in the original graph G,

32
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:42,790
 if and only if that same set S is a clique in the complement graph G bar.

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,105
 So if I look at a graph G and its complement graph, its opposite graph,

34
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:50,375
 then a set S is an independent set in the original graph,

35
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:54,924
 if and only if the set S is a clique in the opposite graph G bar.

36
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,380
 Now I call it an observation because it doesn't really

37
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,365
 require a proof after observing this statement.

38
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,225
 If S is an independent set,

39
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:05,185
 that means for all pairs of vertices X,Y and S,

40
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:07,115
 they are not connected by an edge.

41
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,755
 And therefore, in G bar,

42
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,330
 they are connected by an edge.

43
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,900
 And therefore, S is fully connected in G bar.

44
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,755
 And similarly, if S is a clique in G bar that means

45
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:23,025
 all pairs X,Y are connected by an edge than in the original graph G,

46
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:25,085
 all pairs are not connected by an edge.

47
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,185
 And therefore, it's an independent set.

48
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:27,185
 S does not contain any edges in the original graph G.
