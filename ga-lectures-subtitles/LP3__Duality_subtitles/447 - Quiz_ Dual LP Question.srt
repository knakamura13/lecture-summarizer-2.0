00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,725
 Let's get some practice writing the dual LP.

2
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:07,800
 Here's a simple example LP with three variables: x_1, x_2, and x_3.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,555
 The objective function is to maximize five times x_1 minus 7x_2 plus 2x_3.

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:16,265
 There are two constraints.

5
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:21,035
 The first constraint is that x_1 plus x_2 minus 4x_3 is in most one.

6
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:25,710
 The second constraint is that 2x_1 minus x_2 is at least three.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,890
 And, finally, there's the non-negativity constraint x_1,

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,895
 x_2, and x_3 are at least zero.

9
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,325
 For this primal LP,

10
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,275
 what is its dual LP?

11
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,040
 Now, let's break it up into several parts,

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,715
 then do it more slowly.

13
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:41,470
 The first question is: how many variables are in this dual LP?

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,010
 And the second question is: how many constraints in this dual LP?

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,584
 And by constraints we're not counting the non-negativity constraints,

16
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:50,475
 so this one has two constraints.

17
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:52,890
 So, let's first address these two questions and

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:52,890
 then we'll address the details of the dual LP.
