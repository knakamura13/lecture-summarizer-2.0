1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
 Let's do a quick sanity check.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,295
 Let's take a primal LP.

3
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,635
 So take a primal LP in canonical form,

4
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,740
 maximize C transpose X,

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,600
 Ax is at most B,

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,180
 X is at least zero.

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,695
 Now let's take the dual of this LP and then let's take the dual of that dual LP.

8
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:19,120
 What should the final result be?

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,610
 Well, it should be equivalent to the original LP.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,460
 The dual of the dual should be the primal.

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,030
 So let's check that as true.

12
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,155
 Let's take the dual of this LP.

13
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:32,449
 This gives us minimize B transpose Y.

14
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,820
 Our variables now are Y.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,885
 The constraints are that A transpose Y is at least C,

16
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:38,530
 and Y is nonnegative.

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,705
 Now we want to take the dual of this LP.

18
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:43,650
 First, we have to convert it into a canonical form.

19
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,305
 Now in order to convert this LP into canonical or standard form,

20
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,980
 it changes min into a max.

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,240
 So we multiply it by negative 1.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,040
 This minimization is equivalent to maximizing negative B transpose Y.

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,050
 We do a similar trick to convert this greater than or

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,440
 equal to constraint into a less than or equal to constraint.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,410
 It becomes negative A transpose Y is at

26
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,955
 most negative C and we keep the last non-negativity constraint.

27
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,760
 Now let's take the dual of this LP.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,880
 Let's denote the new variables as Z.

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,530
 The dual will be a minimization problem.

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,040
 The objective function will be defined by this vector,

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,370
 negative C. So we get negative C transpose times Z as the objective function.

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,715
 The constraints will be defined by the transpose of this,

33
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:35,875
 so it will simply be negative A times Z is at least negative B.

34
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,770
 And Z is at least 0.

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,010
 Now if you convert this into canonical or standard form,

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,450
 the objective function becomes maximize

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:51,260
 C transpose Z which is the same as the original primal LP with X replaced by Z.

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,380
 And this constraint becomes A times Z is at most B.

39
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,565
 Which is again, is equivalent to the original constraint with X replaced by Z.

40
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:04,510
 So these two LPs are equivalent.

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,590
 So if you take an LP and you take it's dual,

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,515
 and then you take it dual once again,

43
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:09,515
 you get back the original LP. The primal LP.
