1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,790
 Let's take two matrices, w,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,133
 and y, where w is of size a times b.

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,140
 So, it's got A rows and B columns.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,330
 And Y is of size b time c. So,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,570
 it's got the rows and c columns.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,020
 And this will create the product of these matrices.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,965
 So, we're looking at Z, which is W times Y.

8
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:21,030
 Now, note that Z is going to be of size a times c. It's going to have A rows,

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,920
 it's going to have the same number of rows as

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,680
 W and it's going to have C columns the same number of columns as Y.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,105
 Now, let's look at the multiplication a little more carefully.

12
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:33,110
 Now, here's an example where we're multiplying W times Y,

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,010
 W has a lot of rows and a few columns, B columns.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,920
 Similarly, Y has a few rows,

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,706
 it has B rows, and it's got a lot of columns,

16
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:46,120
 C. The product matrix,

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,970
 Z, is going to have A rows and C columns.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,070
 Let's look at a specific entry Z, i, j.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,705
 Row i. Column j. How do we get this entry?

20
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:04,480
 What we do is, we take row i from W and we

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,665
 take column j from Y and do the inner product of those entries.

22
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,585
 So, we move along the row and the column,

23
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:16,510
 K going from one to b and we take the Kth entry of

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,515
 this row times the Kth entry of this column.

25
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,710
 We multiply those together and then we take the sum of these b terms.

26
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,371
 So, to compute this one entry Z, i, j,

27
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:33,995
 it took us b multiplications and b-1 editions.

28
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,440
 Now, Z has a, c entries.

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,722
 So, in total, there will be a, c,

30
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:42,870
 b multiplications and there'll be roughly the same number of additions.

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,930
 So, therefore, we're going to say the cost of multiplying these matrices is a,

32
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,970
 b, c. Since these two terms are about the

33
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,360
 same and multiplications take longer than additions.

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,380
 So, this is a dominant factor.

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,670
 So, the cost of computing Z, the product matrix,

36
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,883
 W times Y is a, b,

37
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:01,883
 c where W has size a times b and Y has size b times c.
