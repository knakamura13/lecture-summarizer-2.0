Reducing SAT to 3SAT involves transforming a SAT problem's input formula (f) into a 3SAT-compatible formula (f'). The challenge is to ensure that large clauses in f, with possibly n literals, are converted into clauses of at most three literals. The transformation must preserve the essential property that a satisfying assignment (σ') for f' can be converted into a satisfying assignment (σ) for f, and vice-versa. This bi-directional satisfaction ensures that if there are no satisfying assignments for f', yielding a "No" from an algorithm, then f must also have no satisfying assignments, allowing a consistent "No" response for the original SAT problem. Therefore, the goal is to construct an algorithm that uses 3SAT solutions to solve SAT problems efficiently and equivalently.
