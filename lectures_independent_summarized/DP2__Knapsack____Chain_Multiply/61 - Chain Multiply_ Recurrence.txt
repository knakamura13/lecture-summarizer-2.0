Determining the entry C(i,j) involves calculating the matrix product of Ai through Aj. This is depicted as the root of a tree in a graphical representation. The task is to find optimal splits, represented by an index L, where Ai to Al forms the left subtree, and Al+1 to Aj forms the right subtree. The recurrence approach involves trying all split indices L, adding the minimum cost for computing the left and right subtrees (found in a precomputed table) to the combine cost. The combine cost for matrices of sizes Mi-1 by Ml and Ml by Mj is Mi-1*Ml*Mj. The minimum sum of costs among all potential L splits is chosen, totaling C(i,L) plus Cl+1,j, plus the combine cost.
