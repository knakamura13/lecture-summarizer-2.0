1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,620
 let's take a look pictorially at these

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,990
 five constraints now once again we have

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,130
 two variables so we're in

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,270
 two-dimensional space

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,700
 now our first constraint says that x1 is

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,400
 a most 300 so we have this line x1

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,530
 equals 300 and we're looking at the left

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,450
 side all points on the left side of this

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,210
 line the second constraint is that x2 is

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,369
 the most 200 so we're looking at our

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,680
 points below this line and we want

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,350
 points satisfying both constraints so

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,460
 we're looking at the points in the

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,080
 bottom left quadrant of these two

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,840
 vectors next we have the non-negative

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,149
 constraints putting in both non-negative

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,739
 constraints now we lie in this rectangle

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,170
 and then we have our final our fifth

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,090
 constraint which says that we lie on

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,940
 this side of this line hence this tan

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,670
 region is our feasible region all the

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,160
 points in this tan region in this convex

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,160
 polygon satisfy all five constraints
