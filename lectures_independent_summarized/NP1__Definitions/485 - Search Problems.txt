A search problem requires an instance (I) as input and either produces a solution (S) if one exists or outputs "NO" if no solutions exist. The definition of a search problem includes a condition that any given solution must be verifiable in polynomial time to ensure that S truly addresses I. Verification only applies to positive instances where a solution can exist; no verification is needed for instances where there are no solutions. To demonstrate that a problem is a search problem, an algorithm must be provided that can verify proposed solutions (S) given an instance (I) efficiently in polynomial time relative to the size of I. This involves presenting an algorithm as proof, which typically is straightforward to do. The text implies that this concept has been applied to various example problems covered in a course.
