Modular arithmetic, fundamental in the RSA algorithm, involves calculating the remainder when dividing numbers. When assessing X modulo two (X mod 2), it reveals the least significant bit of an integer X, indicating its parity: 1 if odd, 0 if even. In general, X mod N provides the remainder of X divided by any positive integer N. Congruence in this system is denoted with three lines instead of two. Two numbers X and Y are congruent modulo N (X â‰¡ Y mod N) if they leave the same remainder when divided by N. This equivalency is crucial for understanding mathematical relationships within modular arithmetic.
