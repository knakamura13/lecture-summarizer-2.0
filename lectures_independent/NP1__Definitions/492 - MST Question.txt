So recall the MST problem. The input to the problem is an undirected graph G with positive edge lengths, and the output is a tree T with minimum weight. Now let's test your knowledge of P and NP. So the first question is, is the MST problem in NP? Mark whether this statement is true or false. The second question is whether the MST problem is in the class P. Is that statement true or false?
