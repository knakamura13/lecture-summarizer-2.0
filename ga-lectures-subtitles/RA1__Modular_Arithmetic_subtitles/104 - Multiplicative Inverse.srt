00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,755
 A key concept that we're going to need for the RSA algorithm are multiplicative inverses.

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,970
 Now the concept is a bit subtle for a modular arithmetic.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,010
 Let's go back and look at the normal,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,130
 real numbers and see what multiplicative inverses mean there.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,740
 If we take a number three,

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,480
 what's its multiplicative inverse, it's one third.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,620
 And so if we look at three times one third what do we get? We got one.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,235
 And in general for a number a,

9
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,890
 it's multiplicative inverse is one_over_a.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,680
 And, when we multiply those two together what do we get?

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,640
 One. Now we're going to have a number z and we want to look at its inverse

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
 mod N. So we want to know what one_over_z_mod_N is.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,750
 So we're going to define it as the number,

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,440
 so that when we do z_times_one_over_z we get back one.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,060
 So our definition of the inverse of z_mod_N,

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,670
 this is number x,

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,165
 so that if we do x_times_z, we get one_mod_N.

18
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:58,640
 In this case x is the inverse, it's one_over_z_mod_N.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,630
 And the notation is that x is z_to_the_negative_one,

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,585
 same as one over Z.

21
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:09,516
 So x is z_to_the_negative_one_mod_N.

22
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:12,495
 So x is the multiplicative inverse of z_mod_N.

23
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:17,265
 Notice also, that if x is the inverse of z_mod_N,

24
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:19,877
 then z is the inverse of x_mod_N,

25
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:22,705
 because x_times_Z is one_mod_N.

26
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:27,415
 So, x is the inverse of z and z is the inverse of x_mod_N.

27
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:30,540
 Now let's go ahead and look at a specific example to make sure this notion of

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:30,540
 multiplicative inverse modulo N makes sense.
