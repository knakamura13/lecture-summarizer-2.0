1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
 Now, let's look at how we compute inverses.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,710
 To do this, we're going to use the extension of

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,890
 Euclid's algorithm called the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,825
 Euclid's algorithm takes as input two parameters X and Y.

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,955
 And the same will be true for Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

6
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,355
 These parameters x and y are integers,

7
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:19,500
 and we assume that these parameters are ordered,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,190
 so that x is at least y and both of these are non-negative.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,710
 Now, here's the difference: the output of the algorithm

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,475
 here is three parameters--the alpha and beta.

11
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,350
 These are integers.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,150
 Now D is the gcd of x and y.

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,780
 So, if we just pay attention to the first parameter d,

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,930
 this will behave just as in Euclid's algorithm.

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,370
 Now, what are these additional parameters alpha and beta?

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,750
 Well these parameters alpha and beta satisfy the following relation.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,210
 D is guaranteed to equal x times alpha plus Y Times beta.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,791
 Well, this is a bit mysterious,

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,425
 why do I want an alpha and beta which satisfy this relation?

20
00:00:56,425 --> 00:01:00,230
 Let's look at, why it's useful to have an alpha and beta satisfying this relation.

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,780
 Recolor goal is to compute inverses.

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,830
 We're going to be in a setting where we're going to run extended

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,185
 Euclide on x and capital N.

24
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:11,695
 We're trying to compute the inverse of x mod N. First off,

25
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,970
 do we know that this inverse exists?

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,350
 Well, we have to look at the gcd of x and N,

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,330
 to see whether the inverse exists.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,565
 We need them to be relatively prime.

29
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:25,560
 We need that the gcd of x and N is 1 and then the inverse exists.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,040
 Well, when we run extended Euclid algorithm,

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,115
 d the first parameter gives us the gcd of x and y.

32
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:34,260
 In this case it's x and N,

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,970
 so if d equals 1 then we know the inverse exists.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,960
 So where in this scenario where d equals 1,

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,330
 when we run extended Euclid on x and N

36
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,140
 and we get back this alpha and beta which satisfy this relation.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,045
 So we know that one equals x times alpha plus N times beta.

38
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,835
 Now from this alpha or this beta,

39
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:57,235
 can we figure out the inverse of x mod N?

40
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:59,125
 Well this relation is true,

41
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,595
 so now if we take mod N of both sides,

42
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:03,590
 then the relation will still be true.

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,144
 So, now we have that 1 is congruent to X alpha plus N times beta mod N.

44
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:10,770
 Now can we simplify this?

45
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,346
 Yeah, look at the second term here on the right hand side.

46
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,525
 This is N times beta.

47
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:19,280
 This is a multiple of N, therefore it's zero mod N. So,

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,610
 we are going to place N times beta by zero.

49
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,070
 So, that goes away and what are we left with,

50
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,845
 we're left with one is congruent to x times

51
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:30,381
 alpha mod N. That means that alpha is the inverse of x mod N,

52
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:37,080
 because alpha is the integer where X times that integer alpha is congruent to 1 mod N,

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,500
 that's the definition of its inverse.

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,698
 So, we shown that alpha is the inverse of x mod N,

55
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,520
 in the case where d,

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,980
 the gcd of the two parameters, is equal to 1.

57
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,705
 And similarly beta is the inverse of an N mod x.

58
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,588
 So, in the case where these two parameters are relatively prime to each other,

59
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,085
 so their gcd is 1,

60
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:58,085
 so d equals 1, then alpha gives the inverse of x mod y and beta gives inverse of y mod x.
