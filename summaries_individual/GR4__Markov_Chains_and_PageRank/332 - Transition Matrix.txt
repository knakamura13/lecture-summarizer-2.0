Random walk defined as Markov chain, N denotes num. of web pages/vertices in graph. Transition matrix size N x N includes two scenarios regarding Y to X edge: with/without hyperlink. Without hyperlink, transition probability is prod. of (1 - Alpha) chance of random navigation and equal prob. of 1/N for each page. With hyperlink, add probability Alpha of choosing the hyperlink, divided by the num. of Yâ€™s out-links. Ensures all vertex pairs connected, albeit with potentially minuscule weights, creating an ergodic Markov chain. This infers a unique stationary distribution Pi, independent of start state, reached over time for any starting position. Pi, the stationary probability of page X, is equated to its PageRank, representing its importance.
