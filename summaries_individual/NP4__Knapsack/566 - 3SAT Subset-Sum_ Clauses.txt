Encoding 3SAT clauses into subset-sum problem using binary numbers where first n digits rep clauses, following m digits for vars. Literal Xi in Cj leads to 1 in n+j position of number Vi. Xi bar gives 1 in n+j position of Vi prime. Numbers Vi, Vi prime track clauses. In example: X1 bar, X2 bar, X3 in first clause, correlate with 1s in V1 prime, V2 prime, V3 prime. For clause satisfiability, need at least one of V1 prime, V2 prime, V3 prime present - place a 3 in corresponding position in target sum t. Buffer numbers S1, S1 prime, etc., used to achieve necessary sum if only one literal in clause is true. Full satisfiability means at least one literal in each clause must be true; can augment with buffers to match sum t. Example: V1 is 1000011, V1 prime is 1001100; t is 1113333. Reduction from 3SAT to subset-sum formulated.
