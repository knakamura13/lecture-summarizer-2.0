1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,615
 Now, let's get the idea for the proof of correctness of

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:05,980
 Kruskal's algorithm by looking at our earlier example.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,190
 So, recall what Kruskal's algorithm is going to do.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,295
 It's going to consider these edges by increasing weight.

5
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,920
 So, we're going to add in these first five edges.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,965
 The sixth edge we're going to skip because it creates a cycle.

7
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,770
 Then we add in these five edges of weight seven.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,058
 And then finally we're going to consider one of these edges of weight nine.

9
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:27,972
 Now, which edge of weight nine do we consider first?

10
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,810
 Well, that's an arbitrary choice.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,575
 Let's suppose we consider this edge of weight nine first.

12
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,340
 Let's mark the end points as V and

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,200
 W. Now in general how are we going to prove that this algorithm is correct?

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,055
 Well, we're going to do it by induction.

15
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:43,445
 So, let's suppose that the algorithm is correct so far,

16
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,280
 so that the current X is correct so far.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,770
 What does that mean to be correct so far?

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,775
 That means that these edges are part of an MST.

19
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:56,155
 So, there is MST T and X is a sub-graph of T. So,

20
00:00:56,155 --> 00:01:00,075
 we're on our way to an MST to a solution to this problem.

21
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,700
 So, we're assuming that these red edges,

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,995
 which I've now highlighted as green edges,

23
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:05,980
 are part of an MST.

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,180
 Now let's suppose that we add this edge that we're

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,580
 considering right now to this sub-graph X.

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,940
 If we don't at this edge to the sub-graph X,

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,950
 then X is still part of MST.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,520
 But, if we add this edge E to this sub-graph X,

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,385
 then we want to make sure that X union E is part of MST.

30
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,145
 And that's our claim that we're going to prove.

31
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:29,175
 We're going to prove that X union E is part of MST.

32
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:32,280
 T prime, T prime might be different than T. So,

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,010
 we might be heading in the direction of a different a MST than we were headed for before,

34
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,785
 but we're still on our way to an MST.

35
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:42,650
 Now, what is the key property that ensures that adding E

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,350
 to X ensures that we're still on our way to an MST.

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,118
 Well, when are we adding this edge E to X?

38
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:50,780
 When we look at the component containing V,

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,320
 which are these six vertices and we look at the component containing W,

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,820
 which are these two vertices.

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,560
 These are different components.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,950
 Therefore, we can add this edge and it doesn't create any cycles.

43
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,800
 Now, the key property is that if we consider one of these components,

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,310
 let's say the component containing V and we let S be the set of

45
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,690
 vertices and the component containing V. An S_bar is the complement of this set.

46
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,675
 So that's the rest of these vertices.

47
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,390
 Then the key property is that our current subset X,

48
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,650
 has no edges which go from S to S_bar.

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,365
 If there was an edge that goes from S to S_bar,

50
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:30,260
 then that vertex in S_bar which is connected to S would be added into S. So,

51
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,315
 it would be in the component containing V. This component is a maximal set.

52
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:39,710
 So, we know that nobody in S_bar is connected to anybody in S. Therefore,

53
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,170
 there are no edges of X going from S to the rest of the graph.

54
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,405
 That's the definition of a component.

55
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:50,270
 So X has no edges that go between S and S_bar.

56
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,513
 So, X doesn't cross between S and the rest of the graph, S_bar.

57
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:58,442
 But this edge E does cross between S and S_bar,

58
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:02,810
 because V is in S and W is not in S. Now,

59
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,910
 what is the key property about E?

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,375
 E is a minimum weight edge crossing from S to S_bar.

61
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,540
 Now, there are several edges of minimum weight crossing

62
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,020
 between S and S_bar, two in particular.

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,375
 We can take any of those minimum weight edges.

64
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:21,245
 For any minimum weight edge crossing between S and S_bar.

65
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:23,514
 If we add E to X,

66
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:28,730
 then X union E will be part of an MST. That's what we're going to prove.

67
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,880
 And we're going to prove in general that if we take a subset of edges,

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,930
 which are part of an MST and we take an edge which crosses from S

69
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,625
 to S_bar of minimum weight and no other

70
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,050
 edges of this current subset cross from S to S_bar.

71
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,918
 So, this minimum weight edge crossing from S to S_bar.

72
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:52,530
 Then we can add this edge into our current subset and that will still be part of MST.

73
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,275
 This general claim will be known as the cut property.

74
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:58,375
 Before we go ahead and formalize the cut property statement,

75
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,880
 let me formalize what I mean by a cut.

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 This partition of vertices into S and S_bar.
