R being investigated for primality needs Fermat witnesses, Z, proving R composite if Z^R-1 ≠ 1 mod R. All composite Rs have ≥1 Fermat witness, shown by choosing a divisor of R as Z. Since Z and R share a GCD > 1, Z has no inverse mod R (inverse exists iff GCD(Z,R)=1). Assuming Z^R-1 = 1 mod R wrongly suggests Z has an inverse (Z^R-2), contradicting absence of an inverse, thus proving Z^R-1 must not equal 1 mod R and R is composite with a Fermat witness.
