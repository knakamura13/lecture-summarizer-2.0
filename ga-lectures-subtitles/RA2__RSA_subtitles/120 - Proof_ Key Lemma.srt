1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,335
 Let me prove to you now that this fact that S and S prime are the same sets,

2
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:05,770
 just in different order.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,980
 Recall S as a set one,

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,990
 two, three, up to P minus one,

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,925
 where P is a prime number from the hypothesis of the theorem statement.

6
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:17,730
 And the set S prime is the following,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,170
 first element is Z mod P,

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,995
 the second element is 2Z mod P, and so on.

9
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:26,190
 The last element is P minus one times

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,960
 Z mod P. Now let's go ahead and prove that S and S prime are the same.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,390
 We're going to show that the elements of S prime are distinct and non-zero.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,190
 What are the possible values for the elements of S prime?

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,796
 We take them all mods P, right?

14
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,995
 So they're all between zero and P minus one.

15
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:46,270
 Okay. So those are possible values,

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,750
 zero up to P minus one.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,590
 Now if we show they're all non-zero then the possible values are one,

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,175
 two, up to P minus one.

19
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:56,515
 So, this P minus one possible values.

20
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,015
 How many elements are there in S prime?

21
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,650
 Well there's P minus one elements in there.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,006
 So, since the size of S prime is P minus one,

23
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:09,105
 and the possible values are P minus one possible values.

24
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:12,270
 So if they're all distinct then they must contain

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,630
 exactly each of these elements one time and,

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,860
 therefore, it's the same.

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,030
 S prime is the same as S,

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,830
 just in possibly different order.

29
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,090
 So, once we show that the elements of S prime are distinct and non-zero, we're done.

30
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,375
 Let's start off by showing that they're distinct.

31
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,580
 We'll do it by contradiction.

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,560
 So let's suppose they're not distinct.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,505
 So let's suppose for some I not equal to J.

34
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:38,230
 The Ith element and the Jth element of S prime are the same.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:45,480
 The Ith element of S prime is I times Z mod P and the Jth element of S prime

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,500
 is J times Z mod P. So we're

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,260
 supposing that the Ith element and the Jth element are the same,

38
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,560
 so that IZ is congruent to JZ mod P. Now let's use the fact that P is a prime.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,790
 If P is a prime, what do we know?

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,365
 We know then that every element in S has an inverse mod P. So,

41
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,715
 Z is an element in S, right?

42
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,580
 Z is a number between one and P minus one.

43
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,510
 So to recap, P is a prime so that implies

44
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,470
 that Z has an inverse mod P. So, let's use that inverse.

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,140
 What can we do? Look at this equation IZ is congruent to

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,085
 JZ mod P. Let's multiply both sides by Z inverse. It exists.

47
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:34,120
 I don't know what it is, but no matter what it is multiply both sides by Z inverse, okay?

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,040
 So what do we get?

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,693
 So, I multiplied the left hand side by Z inverse and the right hand side by Z inverse.

50
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,326
 What do I get? Now I have Z times the inverse. What is that?

51
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,370
 That's one. Z times the inverse, that's one.

52
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,546
 What am I left with?

53
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:50,975
 I is congruent to J mod P. What does that mean?

54
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:54,980
 That means they're the same when I look between one and P minus one.

55
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,065
 So, therefore, they're the same index.

56
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,651
 I suppose that they were different indexes,

57
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:04,304
 which gave me the same value but in order to come up with the same value,

58
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,580
 they have to be the same index.

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,925
 So I get my contradiction.

60
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:13,358
 Therefore, there is no repeat elements in S prime and they're all distinct.

61
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,566
 Now, we've shown that the elements of S prime are distinct.

62
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:20,350
 Now let's show that the elements of S prime are non-zero.

63
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,980
 Again, let's do a proof by contradiction.

64
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,830
 Suppose one of the elements is zero.

65
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,880
 So take the Ith element of S prime and suppose it's zero.

66
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,914
 So that means I time Z is congruent to zero mod p. What do we know?

67
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:35,200
 We know the inverse of Z exists mod P, right?

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,060
 So let's multiply both sides by Z inverse again,

69
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,140
 and what are we left with?

70
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,267
 We're left with I is congruent zero mode p,

71
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:46,435
 which means that I is not one of the indices here,

72
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,065
 the indices here are between one and P minus one.

73
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,980
 So this is not an element of S prime.

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,251
 So we get a contradiction,

75
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:59,045
 therefore the elements of S prime are non-zero and they're distinct and therefore,

76
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:01,700
 they contain the elements one through P minus

77
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,937
 one just in possibly different order and therefore,

78
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:04,937
 S and S prime are the same.
