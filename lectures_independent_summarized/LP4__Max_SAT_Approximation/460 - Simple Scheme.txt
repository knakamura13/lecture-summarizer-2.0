Considering input f to the max stack problem with variables X_1 to X_n and clauses C_1 to C_M. A true-false assignment to the variables is made randomly without factoring in the formula f. Each X_i has a 50% chance to be true and 50% to be false, akin to a coin flip. Performance is gauged by the number of satisfied clauses, referred to as W, which is a random variable. The focus is on the expected value of W, reflecting its average weighted by probabilities, with possible values from 0 to m. Analyzing this expectation directly is challenging due to dependencies between clauses. The analysis simplifies by breaking down W into individual clauses treated independently, allowing for easier expectation calculations clause by clause.
