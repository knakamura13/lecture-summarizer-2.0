In graph theory, a cut is defined in an undirected graph G as a set of edges that divides the vertices into two disjoint subsets: S and its complement S bar. The edges constituting this cut are those connecting a vertex in S to a vertex in S bar. The distinction is vital for optimization problems in graph theory, specifically when seeking a minimum cut, which strives to minimize the number of edges required to separate the graph into at least two components, and the maximum cut, aimed at maximizing the size of the cut. Understanding the basic concept of a graph cut is foundational before exploring these optimization challenges.
