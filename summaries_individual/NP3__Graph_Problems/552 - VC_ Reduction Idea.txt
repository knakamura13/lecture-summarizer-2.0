Red vertices represent a vertex cover in a graph, while white vertices are an independent set. Evidence suggests that a minimum vertex cover corresponds to an independent set, with a general claim that a vertex set S is a cover if its complement S bar is independent, implying a one-to-one correlation between vertex covers and independent sets. Proving this claim facilitates a reduction from the problem of finding an independent set to finding a vertex cover.
