Proposed solution for web page ranking involves scaling each inbound link by the linking page's outbound links. Simple counts are unfair, as shown by the disparity in value between a link from a less significant personal webpage versus a prominent site like CNN. To reflect importance, the rank of a linking page (Pi) should determine its citation value. Thus, the worth of a citation is proportional to the rank of the referring page, divided by the number of outbound links it has. For example, a link from CNN is divided amongst its outbound links, assigning each linked page a fraction of CNN's total rank value. The system ensures citations from authoritative pages are more valuable, influencing a page's rank accordingly.
