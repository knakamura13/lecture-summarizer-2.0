1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,995
 Now, let's go back to our original question.

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:05,355
 Suppose X inverse mod N exists,

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,725
 how many such inverses can there be?

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:09,195
 So, in this example,

5
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:11,575
 three has an inverse mod 11,

6
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:13,645
 four is one such inverse.

7
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,340
 Are there any other inverses?

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,590
 When we're looking at integers between zero and 10,

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,720
 what's easy to check that four is the only integer between

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,220
 0 and 10 which is an inverse of three mod 11.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,547
 And what we want to prove now is that if X has an inverse mod N,

12
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:31,050
 then there is a unique such inverse.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,775
 So, there is only one such inverse.

14
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:36,180
 Let's prove now that if the inverse exists,

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,590
 it's a unique choice.

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,520
 So, there's a unique number between zero and N minus one,

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,435
 which is an inverse of X mod N. How are we going to prove this?

18
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:47,400
 Let's prove it by contradiction.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,770
 So, let's suppose that X mod N has two inverses.

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,185
 And then, let's show a contradiction.

21
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:59,010
 So, suppose that Z is an inverse of X mod N,

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,350
 and suppose that Y is also an inverse of

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,760
 X mod N. And let's suppose that these numbers Y and Z are different.

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,230
 What do we mean different? We mean,

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,150
 they are different mod N. So,

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,200
 we're assuming that Y and Z are different mod N. This means that if we

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,520
 think of the Y and Z as numbers between zero and N minus one,

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,155
 Y and Z are different.

29
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:21,810
 For this small example for these small numbers,

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,770
 it's easy to verify that this number three can have multiple inverses mod 11.

31
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,425
 We want to prove, in general,

32
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,880
 that if a number X has an inverse mod N,

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,415
 and that inverse is unique.

34
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:36,165
 So, we're assuming that there's multiple inverses of

35
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,765
 X mod N. And we're denoting those as Y and Z.

36
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,465
 And now we're going to derive a contradiction.

37
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:44,265
 Now Z is an inverse of X mod N,

38
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:45,765
 so what does that mean?

39
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:48,685
 That means that if we look at the product of X and Z that

40
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:52,395
 congruent to one mod N. That's the definition of an inverse.

41
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,525
 Similarly, if we look at Y,

42
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:58,890
 we know that X times Y is also congruent to one mod N. Therefore,

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,030
 X times Y is congruent to X times Z mod N. Now,

44
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,210
 we know that the inverse of X mod N exists.

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,355
 Actually, we're supposing that there's multiple such inverses.

46
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,910
 Anyways, take one of those inverses and multiply

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,010
 both sides of this equation by that inverse.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,081
 So, multiply the left side and the right side by X inverse. What do you get?

49
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,945
 Well, X inverse times X is one,

50
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:23,820
 X inverse times X is one,

51
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,690
 so we can cancel these terms,

52
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,305
 and we can cancel out these terms. And what are we left with?

53
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,420
 We are left with the Y and Z.

54
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,485
 So, the left-hand side simplifies to Y,

55
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,675
 the right-hand side simplifies to Z.

56
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,630
 Let's forget this one.

57
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,852
 And we know that Y is congruent to Z mod N.

58
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:44,665
 But our assumption earlier was that Y is not congruent to Z mod N,

59
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,740
 that these are different numbers between zero and N minus one.

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,940
 Therefore, we derived our contradiction, and thus,

61
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,310
 our assumption that there is multiple inverses of X mod N is not true.

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,485
 So, if the inverse of X mod N exists,

63
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,195
 it's a unique such inverse.

64
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:05,485
 It's unique when we look at these numbers between zero and N minus one.

65
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,300
 Later, we're going to prove that if X and N are relatively primes,

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,785
 so the GCD of X and N is one,

67
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:14,955
 then the inverse of X mod N exists.

68
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,720
 How are we going to prove that? We're going to

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,260
 prove that this inverse exists by finding it.

70
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,485
 We're going to show an algorithm extended Euclid algorithm to find the inverse,

71
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:26,605
 when the GCD of X and N is one.

72
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:31,565
 But, on the next slide, we'll prove that if X and N have a common factor,

73
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,525
 so the GCD of X and N is greater than one,

74
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:34,525
 then the inverse of X mod N does not exist.
