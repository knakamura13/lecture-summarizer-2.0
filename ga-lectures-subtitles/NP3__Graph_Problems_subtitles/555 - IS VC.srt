00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Let's detail the reduction from Independent set problem to the Vertex cover problem.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,140
 So we're trying to find an independent set of size at least little g in

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,360
 the input graph capital G. Now we have to define our input for the vertex cover problem.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,860
 We let little b=n-g. And then we run the vertex cover problem on the input graph G,

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,235
 the same graph as before with budget little b.

6
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:26,410
 Now, that defines the reduction.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,045
 Now let's look at the correctness of this reduction.

8
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,700
 What do we know from the claim?

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,285
 What we know that G has a vertex cover of size at most N minus a little g which is b.

10
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:42,055
 So, we have a vertex cover S of this size and we know that in G,

11
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:44,860
 S bar is an independent set and

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,240
 this independent set is going to be of size at least little g. So,

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,056
 if we find a vertex cover of the requisite size in G,

14
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:55,630
 then its complement set is an independent set of

15
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,415
 the desired size in G. And if there is no vertex cover of the requisite size,

16
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:00,415
 then there is no independent set of the desired size.
