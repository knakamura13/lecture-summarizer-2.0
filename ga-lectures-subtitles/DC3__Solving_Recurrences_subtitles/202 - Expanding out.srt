1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,795
 What we've seen so far is that for this recurrence T of N equals

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:08,265
 four T of N over two plus order N by substituting in two times,

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:13,170
 we get to T of N is the most C times N times the quantity.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,390
 One plus two, plus two squared,

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,845
 plus four cubed times T of N over two cubed.

6
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:25,130
 Now notice we're leaving, this is four over two and four over two squared,

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,800
 instead of two and two squared so that we see the geometric series that's going to arise.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,960
 And this illustrates how the geometric series that arises,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,215
 is related to the original recurrence.

10
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:38,955
 The four comes from here and the two comes from this term.

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,515
 At this point, we see the pattern.

12
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:44,460
 So now I suppose instead of substituting in two times we did I times.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,655
 Well, to be precise, let's suppose we're substituting,

14
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,560
 I minus one times.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,160
 So, this geometric series becomes one plus four halves,

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,780
 plus four halves squared,

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,025
 and so on, up to four halves to the I minus one.

18
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:02,900
 And this last term becomes four to the I times T of N over two to the I.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,940
 Now, when do we stop? What I do we stop at?

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,910
 We start when we get to the base case which is when this quantity is one and whether,

21
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,760
 we stop at one or a hundred, it doesn't matter.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,180
 So, let I equal the log base two of N. Then,

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,205
 two to the I is N. So,

24
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,975
 N over N is one.

25
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:23,680
 So, this quantity is one.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,690
 So, substituting in I equal log base two of N,

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,355
 we get the following expression.

28
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,505
 Now, let's try to simplify the terms here.

29
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:33,315
 First off, what is T of one?

30
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,120
 T of one is the most C. So,

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,290
 we can upper bound this by C. What is four to the log base two N?

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,010
 Well, this is order N squared,

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,750
 C times N is order N. Now,

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,810
 what about this geometric series?

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,360
 Now, the key thing is that this geometric series is increasing.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,700
 Four over two is bigger than one it's two.

37
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,620
 So, the last term dominates.

38
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,110
 So, this whole expression is dominated by order the last term.

39
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,865
 So, this geometric series is on the order of four over two to the log base two

40
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:07,910
 N. We can forget about the minus one because that's

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,390
 hidden in the Big O notation because that's just an extra factor of a half.

42
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,410
 Now, let's simplify this quantity.

43
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,290
 The numerator is four to the log base 2N,

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,830
 which we said before is order N squared.

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,180
 The denominator is two to the log base two N which is of course N. So,

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,900
 this quantity is order N. Plugging it in,

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,430
 we have order N, times order N,

48
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,285
 plus order N squared.

49
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,370
 So, this order N squared,

50
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,685
 plus order N squared which is order N squared.

51
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:37,165
 So this recurrence solves the order N squared.

52
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:39,365
 The key element of these recurrences,

53
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:42,225
 is this geometric series that arises.

54
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:42,225
 So, let's take a look at geometric series in general.
