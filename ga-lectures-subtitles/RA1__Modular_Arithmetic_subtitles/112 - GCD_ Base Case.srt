1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,855
 In the base case of our algorithm Y equals zero.

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:05,785
 So, we're looking at the GCD of X and zero.

3
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:08,040
 What are the divisors of zero?

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,640
 This is a case where we should define it in

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,150
 an appropriate way. What is an appropriate way?

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,390
 What is a reasonable manner of defining the divisors of zero?

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,195
 Well, how do we get to this case?

8
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:22,560
 We got to this case by taking the GCD of sum multiple of X with X.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,390
 Because look at what happens when we do the recursive call on this.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,860
 We're going to take kX, mod X,

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,755
 and that's going to be zero.

12
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:33,030
 So, the second parameter is going to be zero and

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,450
 the first parameter will be the second parameter.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,000
 Now, what is the GCD of kX and X?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,460
 Well, this is clearly X,

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,920
 since the first parameter is a multiple of X.

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:42,920
 So, this is why we define the GCD of X and zero to be equal to X.
