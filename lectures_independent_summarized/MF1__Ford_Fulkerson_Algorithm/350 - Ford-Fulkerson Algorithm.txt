The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm approaches maximum network flow by utilizing residual networks. Start with a zero initial flow and construct the residual network which mirrors the flow network initially. Employ DFS or BFS to find a path from source (s) to sink (t); absence of a path halts the algorithm and outputs the current flow as max flow. If a path is found, identify its minimum capacity, denoted c(P), and augment the flow along this path by c(P), increasing flow on forward edges and decreasing on backward edges. Repeat constructing the residual network and searching for an s-t path. Continue until no s-t path exists, then output the current flow as the max flow solution.
