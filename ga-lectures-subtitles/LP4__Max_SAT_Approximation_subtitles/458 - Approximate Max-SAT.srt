1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
 Let's look in detail at what we mean by

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,855
 an approximation algorithm for the Max-SAT problem.

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,890
 Consider an input to the Max-SAT,

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,710
 a formula F where it has M clauses and

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,995
 let's let M* denote the maximum number of satisfied clauses.

6
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:17,795
 So if we look over all assignments to the variables in F,

7
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:21,000
 the maximum number of clauses satisfied by any of

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,940
 those assignments is M* and this is of course dependent on F so

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,950
 let's denote as M* of F. Now let's simplify the notation a little

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,795
 bit and let's drop this of F part and let's simply denote it as M*,

11
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,390
 which is the solution to the Max-SAT problem.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,335
 Now clearly M* is at most M. If M* equals M,

13
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:43,395
 then that means formula F is satisfiable.

14
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:46,700
 Now, we're going to construct an algorithm which we will denote it as to capital A.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,130
 It's going to take a formula F as input and it's going

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,000
 output L on this input F and to be precise actually,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,575
 its going to output an assignment which satisfies L clauses of F. So,

18
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:02,935
 L is the number of clauses satisfied by these assignments outputted by A.

19
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:06,438
 Now how does L compare to the optimal solution M*?

20
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:07,845
 Where in the first instance,

21
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:11,445
 we're going to guarantee that L is at least M* over 2.

22
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,000
 Even though we don't know M*,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,740
 we're going to guarantee that the output of our algorithm is at

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,390
 least within a factor of one half of the optimal number of satisfied clauses.

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,615
 And if this holds for every formula F,

26
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:27,315
 then this is a one half approximation algorithm.

27
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:31,005
 And then later in this lecture we're going to prove one half to three quarters

28
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:31,005
 and we're going to get to three quarters approximation algorithm for the Max-SAT.
