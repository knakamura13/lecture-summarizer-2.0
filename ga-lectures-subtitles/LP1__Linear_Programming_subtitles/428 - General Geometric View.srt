1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
 Now in general, we have n variables.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,875
 So we're going to line n dimensional space.

3
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:06,150
 Now n is large,

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,160
 so we're in high dimensional space.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,165
 Now we m constraints plus the n non-negativity constraints.

6
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,775
 So we have a total n plus m constraints.

7
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:17,390
 Now what's our feasible region?

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,085
 Now, each constraint corresponds to a half space and n dimensions.

9
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:26,755
 Now the feasible region are those points which satisfy all n plus m constraints.

10
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:30,370
 So we want to lie in all n plus m half spaces.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,930
 So the feasible region corresponds to the intersection of these n plus m half spaces.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,765
 Now this is going to correspond to a convex polyhedron in n dimensional space.

13
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:44,070
 Now the vertices of this polyhedron are the corners of it.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,070
 Now how do you get a vertex of this polyhedron?
