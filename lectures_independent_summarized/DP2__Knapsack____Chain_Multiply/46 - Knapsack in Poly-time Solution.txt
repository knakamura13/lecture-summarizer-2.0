The algorithm's runtime for the problem in question is exponential, not polynomial relative to input size, specifically due to the factor capital B. Capital B's representation in bits is proportional to its logarithm (log B). Input size comprises n items plus the log B space needed to represent capital B, denoted as n and log B. Despite being a polynomial in n and B, it is exponential in the actual input size, which includes log B. This aligns with the knapsack problem's categorization as NP-complete, indicating that a polynomial-time solution for knapsack would imply the same for all NP problems, an unlikely prospect given longstanding challenges in the field. The inefficiency is further highlighted by demonstrating that a complex graph problem, when reduced to a knapsack instance, makes capital B exponential relative to graph size, thus causing the runtime to be exponential.
