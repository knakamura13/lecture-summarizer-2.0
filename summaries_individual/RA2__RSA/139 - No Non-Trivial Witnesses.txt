Fermat witnesses are used to determine if a number r is composite; z is a non-trivial Fermat witness if z^(r-1) â‰¢ 1 mod r and z and r are relatively prime. Composite numbers typically have a trivial Fermat witness, but some, known as Carmichael Numbers, do not have non-trivial Fermat witnesses and thus seem prime under Fermat's test. Since Carmichael Numbers (like 561, 1105) are rare, they're usually disregarded, allowing the use of Fermat's test as a simple method to check for primeness, as long as a non-trivial Fermat witness can be identified for composite numbers.
