1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,855
 Now our goal in the max flow problem is to find a valid flow.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,966
 So one satisfying the capacity constraints and the conservation of flow constrains,

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:12,300
 and we want to find a valid flow of maximum size.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,210
 What exactly do we mean by maximum size?

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,870
 What is the size of a flow?

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,990
 Well, the size of the flow is the total flow sent.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:19,990
 This can be measured by the total flow out of s or the flow into t.
