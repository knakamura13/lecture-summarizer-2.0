Have demonstrated that for any sink strongly connected component (SCC) S in a graph, the complement S bar constitutes a source SCC. This is derived from the logical connection that no outgoing edges from any vertex (literal) in S implies no incoming edges to the corresponding complements in S bar. Thus, if all vertices in S lack incoming edges, their complements in S bar lack outgoing edges, confirming S bar as a source SCC. This relationship is reversible, confirming the duality: if S bar is a source then S is a sink SCC. The key fact established is that sink SCCs and source SCCs are complements. The remaining task is to verify the underlying claim supporting this conclusion.
