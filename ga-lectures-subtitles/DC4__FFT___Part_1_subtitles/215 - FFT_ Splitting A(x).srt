1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
 Once again the plus minus property says that

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,500
 the first n points are opposite of the next n points.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,370
 And let's see how this plus minus property is useful for

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,945
 recursively computing a of x at two n points.

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:18,735
 Let's look at a evaluated at the point xi and a evaluated at the point xn plus i.

6
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,075
 Since we're assuming the plus minus property,

7
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,700
 these two points are opposites of each other.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,935
 Now let's break up this polynomial A(x) into the even terms and the odd terms.

9
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,148
 Even terms are of the form a,

10
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:35,565
 two k times x raised to the power two k. Since the powers even,

11
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:39,525
 this is the same for xi and negative xi.

12
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:45,445
 So these even terms are the same for the point xi and the point xn plus i.

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,340
 Now what about for the odd terms.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,335
 Well since it's an odd power it's going to be opposite for xi and xn plus i.

15
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:55,650
 Now given this observation about the even terms and the odd terms,

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,565
 it makes sense to split up A(x) into the even terms and the odd terms.

17
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,315
 So let's partition the coefficients for the polynomial

18
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:07,230
 A(x) into those coefficients for the even terms.

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,515
 Let's call this vector a even and into the coefficients for the odd terms.

20
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:11,515
 Let's call this factor ai.
