1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
 So we try to write Recurrence for D of i, s,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,000
 t. We did the case where the vertex i is not

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,960
 on the shortest path from s to t. And now we want to do the case where

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,140
 vertex i is on the path from s to t. And we're talking about

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,525
 shortest path which only used vertices one through i as intermediate vertices.

6
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:21,660
 So, let's try to figure out the recurrence for this case where i is on

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,265
 the shortest path from s to t. Let's look at our path graphically.

8
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:30,280
 We're starting at s, we're ending at t. We know at some point in the middle,

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,870
 we go through vertex i.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,660
 What are other vertices that we possibly use?

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,020
 We use a subset of vertices one through i as intermediate vertices.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,365
 Vertex i is here,

13
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,620
 so the other vertices that we can possibly use are

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,635
 a subset of vertices one through i minus one.

15
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:46,555
 We don't know anything about that subset,

16
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:50,245
 what order or which particular vertices in that subset are used but,

17
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:52,450
 it's a subset of one through i minus one.

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,280
 Now, what does this path look like?

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,825
 It starts at s and then it goes through some subset of vertices one through i minus one.

20
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,130
 It might be the empty subset of these or might be all of them. We don't know.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,920
 Just goes from s to some subset here then at some point,

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,340
 it visits vertex i.

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,210
 After it visits vertex i, what happens?

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,080
 It goes to some subset of vertices one through i minus one.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,470
 Might be the empty subset, not sure.

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,945
 It might be the full subset.

27
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,840
 And then, afterwards what happens?

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,330
 It finishes at vertex t. So our path can be broken up into these four segments.

29
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,740
 S to this subset,

30
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,855
 then it's going, moving around in that subset.

31
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:36,615
 It might be an empty subset so in which case it's actually skipping,

32
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,155
 it's going directly from s to i.

33
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:41,290
 But it goes from s to this subset,

34
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,470
 towards around the subset, goes to i,

35
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,705
 back down and then goes around the subset and possibly empty,

36
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:53,720
 visit, and then back to t. So we have these four segments of our path.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,360
 Let's rewrite this partition of the path into these four parts in words.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,055
 So we're starting at vertex s,

39
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:05,170
 we visit some subset of vertices one through i minus one possibly empty subset.

40
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,000
 And we visit vertex i then we go back and visit some subset of vertices one

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,010
 through i minus one and then we go to vertex t. And we're trying to express d of i, s,

42
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,260
 t. Now, given our insight of breaking up this path from to s to t into these four parts,

43
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,260
 now it will be straightforward to write a recurrence for d of i, s,t.
