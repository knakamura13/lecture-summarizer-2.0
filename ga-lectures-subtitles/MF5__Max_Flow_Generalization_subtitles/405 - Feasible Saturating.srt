1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,690
 To prove the reverse direction,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,770
 what we want to do now is take a feasible flow f in the graph G,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,750
 and we want to construct a saturating flow f-prime in this new graph G-prime.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,320
 Now for each edge of the original network G,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
 we're going to define the new flow along that edge to be

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,105
 the old flow shifted down by the demand along this edge.

7
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:23,580
 Now that defines a flow for all the edges in the original network.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,350
 What about the new edges that we added to

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,220
 this graph G-prime when we did the construction?

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,090
 Well for every vertex in the original network,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,425
 we have an edge from s-prime and edge to t-prime.

12
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:38,460
 So we have this edge from s-prime to v and v to t-prime.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,940
 Now we're trying to construct a saturating flow.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,138
 So each of these edges is supposed to be fully capacitated.

15
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:48,985
 So we might as well set this flow to be equal to its capacity which is the total demand

16
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:54,765
 into v for this edge and the total demand out of v for the edge two t-prime.

17
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:58,525
 That defines a flow f-prime for all the edges except for one.

18
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:02,915
 We have this edge from t to s which had infinite capacity.

19
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:06,300
 We want to set the flow along this edge to be equal to

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,830
 the size of this flow f. That defines the flow f-prime.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,830
 Now we have to check that f-prime is valid and it's a saturating flow.
