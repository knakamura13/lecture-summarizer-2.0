1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,545
 If for text i is not on the path P,

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:07,545
 then this path P only uses a subset of vertices

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:12,135
 one through i minus one, as intermediate vertices.

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,520
 Therefore, D of i, s,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,480
 t in this case is the same as D of i minus 1, s,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,585
 t. Since we're only using a subset of the

7
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,515
 first i minus one vertices intermediate vertices.

8
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,355
 The solution is obtained by this subproblem.

9
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,930
 The other case is when i is on this path.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:30,930
 Let's dive into this a little bit more carefully.
