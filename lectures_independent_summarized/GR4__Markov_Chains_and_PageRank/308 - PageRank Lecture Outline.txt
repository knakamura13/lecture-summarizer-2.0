Exploring the PageRank algorithm, fundamental to Google's search engine, developed by Brin and Page to quantify webpage importance. Understanding PageRank necessitates familiarity with Markov chains, mathematical models for probability transitions among states, and their intrinsic properties. Central to this is the concept of stationary distribution within Markov chains, crucial for grasping PageRank's design and operation. The discussion will elucidate stationary distribution identification and its relevance to Markov chain characteristics. This foundational knowledge is also applicable to advanced models like MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) and simulated annealing. A specific example of a Markov chain will be analyzed to provide practical insight.
