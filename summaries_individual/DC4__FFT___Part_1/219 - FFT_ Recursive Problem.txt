Choosing two endpoints to exhibit the plus-minus property involves duplicating the first N with their opposites for the second set. Upon recursion, the new endpoints are the squares of the original ones, necessitating the same property. For N as a power of two, each squared endpoint must be the opposite of its pair, but squares yield positive results, making real numbers insufficient. Thus, complex numbers are necessary to maintain the plus-minus property beyond the initial step, leading to a review of complex number properties for the selection of the 2N numbers to fulfill the criteria throughout the recursive process.
