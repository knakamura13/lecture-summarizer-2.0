Now looking into running time of this algorithm, notice this step partitioning the vector a into a even and a odd that takes order and time. This is a recursive call which is of size n over 2. Similarly for a odd it's a recursive call of size n over 2. This computation of the Rs takes order one time for each pair. So takes order n total time. Therefore this running time satisfies the recurrence T event is 2T event over 2 plus order n. And of course this solves the order n log n that completes the FFTL.
