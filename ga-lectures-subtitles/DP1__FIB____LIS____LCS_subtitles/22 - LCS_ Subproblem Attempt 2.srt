1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,765
 So let's go back and revise our subproblem definition with the insight that we just gain.

2
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:07,470
 The key insight was that we're going to need a prefix of

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,560
 x and a prefix of y of possibly different lengths.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,815
 Therefore we're going to have two indices, i and j,

5
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:16,290
 which are going to correspond to the length of the prefix

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,910
 and x and the length of the prefix and y.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,400
 And as a consequence,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,535
 we're going to end up with a two-dimensional table.

9
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,115
 In all our previous examples,

10
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:26,815
 we had a one dimensional array or table.

11
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,805
 And now, we're going to have a two-dimensional table or array,

12
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,480
 because we have two indices, i and j.

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,190
 So let's go ahead and formalize our subproblem definition.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,090
 For indices i and j where once again i varies between 0 and n,

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,910
 and similarly j varies between 0 and n. We're going to define the function.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,530
 We're going to define the function L of i_j,

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,865
 which is the length of the longest common subsequence in

18
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:55,410
 the first i characters of x and the first j characters of y.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,525
 The key is that x is of length i and y is a prefix of length j.

20
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:02,970
 Now let's go ahead and see if we can define

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,435
 recurrence for this new subproblem definition.

22
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,240
 Let's start off with the base cases.

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,245
 Base cases are going to be when i is 0 or j is 0.

24
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,815
 Let's start with considering the case when j is 0.

25
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:19,120
 So what is L of i0 and what is L of 0j for the case when i is 0.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,995
 Well, for Li0, so here j is 0.

27
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:26,305
 That means that y is the empty string.

28
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:28,315
 So what is the longest common subsequence?

29
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,575
 Well, in both where y is the empty string,

30
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:32,935
 so there is no subsequence in it.

31
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,607
 So the length of it is of length 0.

32
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:38,280
 Similarly, if we're taking

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,010
 an empty string for x then the longest common subsequence is the empty string itself,

34
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,945
 which is of length 0.

35
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,390
 So those are two base cases.

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,390
 Let's move on to the more interesting cases.
