1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,995
 Our reduction took this input instance for the independence set problem.

2
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:06,110
 So we took a graph, a capital G,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,750
 with a goal, little g,

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,595
 for the independence set problem,

5
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:13,360
 and we reduced it to the vertex cover problem with input instance,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,215
 capital G, the same graph,

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,945
 and budget, little b.

8
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:20,890
 And little b was defined as n minus little

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,445
 g. Now given a solution s for this vertex cover instance.

10
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,870
 So this is a vertex cover of size at most little b.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,740
 Then we return S-bar as the solution to the independence set problem because

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,135
 we know that if S is a vertex cover of size at most little b,

13
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:41,230
 then we know that S-bar is an independent set of size at least little

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,570
 g. And if our vertex cover problem comes back with no, there's no solution,

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,975
 then when we return no, there's no solution for the independence set problem,

16
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:52,160
 because we have this if and only if statement,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,285
 if there's no solution here and there's no solution here and vice versa.

18
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:59,695
 That completes the reduction and that proves the correctness of the reduction.

19
00:00:59,695 --> 00:00:59,695
 That completes the proof that the vertex cover problem is NP complete.
