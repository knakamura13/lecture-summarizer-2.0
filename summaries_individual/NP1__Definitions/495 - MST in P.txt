The MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) problem, initially stated as NP (nondeterministic polynomial time), is also confirmed to be in P (deterministic polynomial time). This conclusion comes via two steps: first, establishing MST as a search problem, and second, demonstrating that a solution can be found in polynomial time, specifically by applying Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm. This bifurcated approach successfully proves that MST is in P.
