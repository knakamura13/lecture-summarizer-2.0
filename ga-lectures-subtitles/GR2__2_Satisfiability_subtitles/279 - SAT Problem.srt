1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,630
 The input to the SAT problem is a formula f in conjunctive normal form,

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,150
 which is composed of n variables;

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,490
 x1 through xn, and m clauses.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,885
 The output is a satisfying assignment if one exists.

5
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:17,020
 This is an assignment of true or false to each of

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,010
 the variables so that the formula evaluates to true.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,585
 Now if there is no satisfying assignment,

8
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:22,585
 no assignment where the formula evaluates true, then we output no.
