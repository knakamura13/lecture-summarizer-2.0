We've seen how to show that the 3SAT problem is NP-complete. Now let's take a look at a few graph theory examples. We'll start with the Independent sets problem, then will show that the clique problem is also NP-complete. And finally, we'll show that the vertex cover problem is NP-complete. I'll define for you each of these combinatorial problems as we go along, in case you're not familiar with them. Let's dive into the independent sets problem.
