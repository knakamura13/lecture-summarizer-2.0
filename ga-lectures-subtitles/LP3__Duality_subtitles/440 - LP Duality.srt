00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,710
 In this lecture, we'll explore the beautiful theory of LP duality.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,540
 We'll start with a motivating example and then this

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,660
 will lead us into the general formulation of the dual LP.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,450
 And we'll look at the weak duality theorem and some of its consequences.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,450
 And finally, we'll look at the strong version of the duality theorem.
