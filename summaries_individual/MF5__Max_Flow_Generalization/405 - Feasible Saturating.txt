Proving the reverse direction involves transforming a feasible flow f in graph G into a saturating flow f' in a modified graph G'. This adaptation is achieved by reducing the flow in each edge of G by its demand and defining new flows in G' that match the demand at every node, specifically with edges from the new source s' and to the new sink t'. Flows from s' to each vertex and from each vertex to t' are set to match their respective total incoming and outgoing demands. Additionally, the edge from t to s, which has infinite capacity, is assigned a flow equal to the magnitude of flow f. The final step involves validating that the constructed flow f' satisfies all conditions to qualify as a saturating flow in G'.
