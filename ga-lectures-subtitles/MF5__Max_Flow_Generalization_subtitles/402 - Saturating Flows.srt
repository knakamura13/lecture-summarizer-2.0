1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,895
 Now, let's take a look at this graph we constructed.

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:05,970
 What is the maximum flow size that can occur in this graph?

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,460
 Certainly, it's upper bounded by the capacity,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,495
 the total capacity out of S-prime or the total capacity into T-prime.

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,275
 Let's take a look at those quantities.

6
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:22,010
 Let capital D denote the total demand in this original network G. So,

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,065
 we're going to sum over edges in this original network of the demand along that edge.

8
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:30,140
 Notice, this is the same as summing over the vertices of

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,435
 the total demand into the vertex because every edge has one tail.

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,885
 And similarly, we can count from the head of the edge.

11
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:43,890
 So, we can sum over vertices of the total demand out of each vertex.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,680
 Now, in this graph, what does the total capacity out of S-prime?

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,410
 Well, the capacity along this edge from S-prime to a is defined as demand into a.

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,655
 So this total capacity out of vertex S-prime

15
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:03,935
 is a sum over vertices in the original graph of the demand into that vertex.

16
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:06,680
 That's equal to the quantity D. Similarly,

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,370
 if we look at that the total capacity into the vertex T-prime,

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,640
 that's equal to the total demand out of the vertices,

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,410
 which is also equal to capital D. So,

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,155
 if we look at the value of flow F-prime in this new graph G-prime that we constructed,

21
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:26,060
 what do we know about the size of this flow F-prime in this graph G-prime?

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,640
 We know it's upper bounded by the total capacity out of

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,090
 S-prime or the total capacity into T-prime.

24
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,030
 Both of those quantities are capital D. So,

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,470
 the size of this flow F-prime is in most capital D. Therefore,

26
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,500
 we say this flow F-prime is saturating,

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,205
 if the size of this flow F-prime is capital D.

28
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:50,180
 This means that this flow F-prime is of maximum size.

29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,235
 So, all of these edges out of S-prime are fully capacitated, they're fully saturated.

30
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:58,530
 And all these edges into T-prime are fully saturated.

31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,800
 So, in a saturating flow F-prime,

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,565
 we fully capacitated the edges out of S-prime,

33
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:06,890
 and fully capacitated the edges into T-prime.

34
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,680
 What we're going to prove is that G, our original network,

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,380
 has a feasible flow if and only if,

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,580
 this new network G-prime that we constructed has a saturating flow.

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,645
 Once, we prove this lemma,

38
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:20,305
 this gives us a way to find a feasible flow.

39
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:25,055
 What we do is we take our input to the feasible flow problem, we construct G-prime,

40
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,995
 we run max-flow on this graph, G-prime,

41
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:32,045
 and we check if the size of the max-flow is equal to capital D,

42
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:34,160
 and therefore, it is saturating or not.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,555
 If it is a saturating flow, then,

44
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,530
 we know that there is a feasible flow and actually

45
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,950
 our proof of this lemma will give us a construction.

46
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,580
 So, we can take this saturating flow F-prime and construct

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,120
 a feasible flow F for this original network G. So,

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,670
 what we've done so far is transform the input to

49
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,715
 the feasible flow problem into an input to the max-flow problem.

50
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,820
 And now, by proving this lemma,

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,130
 we're going to show how to transform the solution to

52
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,125
 the saturating flow problem or to the max-flow problem on this graph G-prime,

53
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:06,125
 into a solution to the feasible flow problem.
