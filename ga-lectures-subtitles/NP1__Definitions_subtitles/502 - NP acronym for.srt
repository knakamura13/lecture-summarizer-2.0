1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,995
 Now, we have these two complexity classes we'll consider so far, P and NP.

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,510
 What are these abbreviations stand for?

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,390
 P Well, P stands for polynomial time.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,190
 Why? Because this is the class of search problems that can be solved in polynomial time.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,695
 Now you might think that NP stands for non not polynomial time. That's incorrect.

6
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:23,215
 It Is it may be the case that we can solve NP problems in polynomial time as well?

7
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:25,170
 It may be the case that P equals NP.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,050
 We don't know. So what does NP stand for?

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,860
 NP stands for non-deterministic nondeterministic polynomial time.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,270
 What does non-nondeterministic mean?

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,660
 This is a class of problems that can be solved in

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,545
 polynomial time on a non-nondeterministic machine.

13
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:40,710
 That doesn't do much good,

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,240
 I still haven't defined this term non-nondeterministic.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,440
 By nondeterministic, I mean a machine where I'm allowed to

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,830
 guess at each step and there is a series of guesses.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,650
 There is a series of choices which leads to an accepting state.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,590
 If you think of it in terms of a terminal,

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,675
 typically for a terminal,

20
00:00:56,675 --> 00:01:00,970
 I specify on a particular input, say 1 one.

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,016
 I move from this day to this day day,

22
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,255
 and maybe on a particular input 0,

23
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,415
 I moved move from this date day to this other day.

24
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,680
 But now now, I don't have to specify

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,800
 which particular input I move from this day to this day.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,420
 I just specify that sometimes,

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,185
 I might move from this day to this day and sometimes, from this day to this day.

28
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,670
 And for the case I want to terminal,

29
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,150
 I just need that there is a path in this terminal that goes to an accepting state.

30
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,240
 So there is a choice of branchings which leads me to an accepting state.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,425
 I can't really explain it much more than what I just did,

32
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,990
 because to be honest,

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,570
 I don't understand it much more than that.

34
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,095
 But the important thing to remember is that NP does not stand for not polynomial time.

35
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:40,095
 What it stands for is nondeterministic polynomial time.
