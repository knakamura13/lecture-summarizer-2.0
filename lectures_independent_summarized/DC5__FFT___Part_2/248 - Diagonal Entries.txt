Examined the proof for diagonal entries of the product of matrices M(ω_n)^-1 and M(ω_n). M(ω_n) is a matrix associated with FFT, with entries modified by ω_n to the power of their indices. The inverse, M(ω_n)^-1, replaces ω_n with its reciprocal. For the k-th diagonal entry (k,k), the analysis focused on the dot product of the k-th row of M(ω_n)^-1 and the k-th column of M(ω_n). Each term in the dot product equates to one since multiplying ω_n by its reciprocal raised to matching powers results in one. There are n such terms corresponding to the dimension of the matrix; hence, the k-th diagonal entry sums to n, confirming the initial assertion for diagonal entries.
