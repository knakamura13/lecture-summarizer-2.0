Bloom filters are introduced as a new data structure with guaranteed constant query time (order one), unlike traditional hashing schemes where query times are probabilistic. They are simpler, occupy less space, and do not require linked listsâ€”just a binary array. The trade-off for their simplicity and speed is the occurrence of false positives, meaning the filter might incorrectly indicate an element is in the set when it isn't; in the example given, it's an acceptable password wrongly flagged as unacceptable. However, the setting allows for this error because false positives (denying a good password) are preferable over false negatives (accepting a bad password). While this is reasonable and the occurrence rate of false positives is to be analyzed and minimized, Bloom filters are not universally applicable. Suitability depends on whether the benefits of speed and simplicity outweigh the risks of false positives in a given application.
