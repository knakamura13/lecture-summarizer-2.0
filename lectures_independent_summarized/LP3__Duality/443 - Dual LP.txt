To find Y which provides an upper bound to an original objective function, we require Y to satisfy specific constraints so that when plugged into the left hand side (LHS), it yields at least the value of the objective function. For this, we identified that: - Y1 + Y3 must be at least 1 for X1. - Y2 + 3Y3 + Y4 must be at least 6 for X2. - 2Y3 + 3Y4 must be at least 10 for X3. Any Y meeting these conditions establishes an upper bound on the objective function. Our aim is to minimize the right hand side (RHS), which is composed of 300Y1, 200Y2, 1000Y3, 500Y4, yielding the smallest upper bound, thus, defining our dual linear program (LP). The original maximization LP has been converted to a minimization dual LP, with the inequality constraints also flipping from <= to >=. In this dual LP, there's a symmetry with the original LP: - Coefficients from the original LP constraints are now defining the objective function of the dual LP (300, 200, 1000, 500). - Coefficients from the original objective function establish the constraints of the dual LP. Furthermore, the number of variables in the original LP dictates the number of constraints in the dual LP, and the number of constraints in the original LP sets the number of variables in the dual LP. For our case with four constraints in the original LP, the dual will have four variables, resulting in three constraints from the three original variables.
