The simplex algorithm starts at a feasible point, initially the zero vector, which meets N non-negativity constraints. It must also satisfy M additional constraints, otherwise the linear program (LP) is infeasible, with no solutions meeting all constraints. If feasible, the algorithm performs a local search for neighboring vertices to find one with a strictly higher objective function value. It can check up to N times M neighbors, and if a higher-value neighbor is found, the algorithm moves to that point and repeats the process. Multiple better neighbors entail choosing one based on heuristics, like random selection or the highest objective value. However, if no neighbors have a higher value, the current vertex is optimal due to the convexity of the feasible region; no other points can surpass its value, making it the global optimum of the LP. The algorithm is demonstrated through an example with three variables to clarify the process.
