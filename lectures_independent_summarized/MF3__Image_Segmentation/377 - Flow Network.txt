Converting image segmentation to max-flow involves redefining the problem's undirected graph as a directed graph G-prime. In this conversion, each undirected edge between neighboring pixels is replaced with bi-directional edges representing flows in both directions. Capacity constraints on these edges are dictated by separation penalties, labeled as Pij, reflecting the cost of segmenting adjacent pixels. Additionally, the graph incorporates specific vertices representing foreground and background, integrating pixel likelihoods relative to these concepts into the network structure. This setup prepares the image segmentation issue for resolution through max-flow algorithms.
