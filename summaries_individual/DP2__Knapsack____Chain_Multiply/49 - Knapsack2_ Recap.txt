Examining the algorithm to simplify a 2D or 3D table to a smaller version, potentially for optimization in speed, space, or complexity. The specific context is a revised knapsack problem solution, where the argument 'i' tracks considered objects. Due to the allowance of multiple uses of the same object in this problem variant, 'i' is deemed unnecessary. By eliminating 'i', a new knapsack solution will feature only the weight parameter, thus simplifying the solution.
