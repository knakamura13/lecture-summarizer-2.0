00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
 Now, we're going to derive a Primality Testing Algorithm using Fermat's Little Theorem.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,540
 Let's first recall Fermat's Little Theorem.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,610
 If r is a prime number,

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,775
 then for all z in this set,

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,440
 all z between one and r minus one.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,260
 If we look at z raised to the power r minus 1 modulo r,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,185
 then it's congruent to one.

8
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,640
 Now, we're going to use this as the basis for figuring out

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,415
 whether a given number r is prime or not.

10
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,425
 So, if it's prime it satisfies this.

11
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:29,965
 What if it's composite?

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,490
 We'll, what if we find a z between one and r minus one,

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,105
 where z raised to the power r minus one modulo r is not controlling to one.

14
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,985
 We'll, by Fermat's Little Theorem if this is the case,

15
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:43,845
 then what do we know about r?

16
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:47,100
 We'll, r must be composite if there's such a z.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,150
 So, this z where z raised to r minus one is not congruent to one mod r is a witness.

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,725
 It proves that r is composite.

19
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,740
 And hence, we call this z a Fermat witness because

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,135
 it's a witness with respect to Fermat's Little Theorem.

21
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:07,205
 The first question we want to ask is whether every composite number has a Fermat witness.

22
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,210
 The answer to this first question is, yes it does.

23
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,700
 Every composite number has

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,025
 at least one Fermat witness and we'll demonstrate this in a moment.

25
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,654
 After we demonstrate this,

26
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:19,695
 then we have to look at how we find a Fermat witness.

27
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:23,494
 After we show that every composite number has at least one Fermat witness,

28
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:25,990
 then we'll look at how to find Fermat witnesses.

29
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,500
 What will show is that every composite number has many Fermat witness.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,320
 We'll, there are some exceptions called Pseudo Primes but if we ignore Pseudo Primes,

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,925
 then every other composite number has many Fermat witness.

32
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:41,675
 So, in fact it will be easy to find Fermat witnesses for composite numbers.

33
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:44,415
 And that will give us our Primality Testing Algorithm.

34
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:47,335
 And then, we'll see how to deal with these Pseudo Primes.

35
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:47,335
 Let's first prove this fact that every composite number has at least one Fermat witness.
