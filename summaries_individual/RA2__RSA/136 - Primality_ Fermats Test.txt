Deriving a Primality Testing Algorithm based on Fermat's Little Theorem which states that if r is prime, any z (1 ≤ z < r) raised to r-1 modulo r equals one. To test if r is prime, find z where z^(r-1) modulo r ≠ 1; such a z indicates r is composite and serves as a Fermat witness. All composite numbers have at least one Fermat witness; many have a multitude, excluding Pseudo Primes. With numerous witnesses, finding them is straightforward, forming the basis of the Primality Testing Algorithm. The approach includes a strategy for handling Pseudo Primes, thus proving every composite has a Fermat witness.
