A new "best of two" method for bin assignment involves choosing the least loaded of two random bins for each ball. This reduces max load drastically from log n to log log n, significantly diminishing load as n grows. While considering more bins (d bins) offers further reductions in max load (to log log n / log d), gains beyond two bins are marginal. This concept of choosing the best option from multiples will later be applied to enhance hashing and inform the design of Bloom filters.
