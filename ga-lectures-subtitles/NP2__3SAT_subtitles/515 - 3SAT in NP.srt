1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
 Now to prove that 3SAT is in the class ϵNP,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,135
 we have to show that we can verify solutions efficiently.

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:09,310
 So, let's take a particular input for the 3SAT problem.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,260
 So f is our input for the 3SAT problem.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,080
 And let's take a proposed solution.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,650
 So this is a true false assignment for the n variables.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,140
 Now we need to check that this assignment is a satisfying assignment for this formula.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,650
 Now, how are we going to verify that this assignment is a satisfying assignment?

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,525
 Well, we're going to go through the clauses.

10
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,300
 So let's take each clause.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,470
 For a particular clause C,

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,945
 you will take us order one time to check

13
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,710
 that at least one of the literals in C is satisfied.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,220
 Why is it order one time?

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,130
 Because each clause has at most three literals.

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,665
 Now if every clause C is satisfied,

17
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,850
 then the formula f is satisfied.

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,560
 It takes order one time per clause, there's M clauses,

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,880
 so it takes order M total time to verify that this assignment satisfies the formula.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:55,880
 So this proves that the 3SAT problem is in the class ϵNP.
