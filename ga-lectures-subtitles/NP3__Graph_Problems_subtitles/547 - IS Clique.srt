1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 Given this observation, it's now straightforward to show

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,285
 a reduction from the independent set problem to the clique problem.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,028
 Now we're doing a reduction from independent set to clique,

4
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,470
 so we have to take an input for

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,765
 the independent set problem and transform it to an input for the clique problem.

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,315
 So consider an input for the independent set problem.

7
00:00:17,315 --> 00:00:22,765
 This is defined by a graph G and a goal little g. We take the opposite of the G,

8
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:28,980
 that's G bar and we use G bar and the same little g as our input to the clique problem.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,230
 Now we use our observation.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,410
 If we get a set S which is a clique in the opposite graph G bar,

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,100
 then we know that S is an independent set in the original graph

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,000
 G. Now if we get a solution s for the clique problem,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,845
 that means that S is a clique of size at least little g in G bar.

14
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:51,185
 Then we return S as a solution to the independent set problem,

15
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:55,730
 because we know S is an independent set of size at least little g in

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,690
 the original graph capital G. Now if our clique problem returns no.

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,756
 So there's no clique of size at least little g in G bar,

18
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:07,145
 then we return no for the independent set problem,

19
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:09,740
 because we know that there's no independent set of

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,468
 size at least a little g in the original graph G,

21
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:17,985
 because if there was an independent set of sufficient size in capital G,

22
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:23,230
 then we know there would be a clique of sufficient size in the opposite graph G bar.

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,820
 This completes the definition of the reduction and

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,060
 the proof of correctness follows from this observation.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,060
 Therefore, we've shown that the clique problem is NP complete.
