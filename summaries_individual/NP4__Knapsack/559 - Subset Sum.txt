The subset sum problem involves determining whether a subset of n positive integers sums to a specific target value t. If such a subset exists, it is outputted; if not, the output is NO. This problem serves as a useful exercise for dynamic programming techniques, which can solve it with a time complexity of O(nt), where n is the number of integers and t is the target sum. Dynamic programming is recommended for practice with this type of algorithmic challenge.
