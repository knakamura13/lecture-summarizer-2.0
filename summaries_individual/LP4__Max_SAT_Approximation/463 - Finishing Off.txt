Investigated expected no. of satisfied clauses in random assignment. Defined W as random variable for count of satisfied clauses; WJ for individual clause CJ satisfaction. Proved expectation, or probability, that CJ is satisfied ≥1/2 for each M clauses, leading to sum being at least M/2. Thus, random algorithm achieves at least a 1/2 approximation factor in expectation. Demonstrated de-randomization via deterministic algorithm for 1/2 approximation using conditional expectations. Process involves iterating over variables, comparing two possible settings (True/False) for each variable given fixed settings for previous variables, computing expected performance for each, and choosing the better setting before proceeding to next variable. Noted the method doesn't address the optimal number of satisfied clauses but guarantees a random assignment satisfies ≥1/2 of the clauses, providing at least a 1/2 approximation relative to the max possible satisfied clauses. Established every formula has at least one assignment satisfying ≥1/2 of clauses, implying there's at least one setting reaching or surpassing average M/2 satisfaction.
