In the given image example, parameters were set to define the likelihood of pixels being in the foreground or background, with white pixels more likely foreground and black pixels likely background. Notably, the matrix defining this is symmetric, allowing for the foreground and background labels to be reversible. Sample separation penalties are applied when pixels differ, but in this case, there is no penalty for separating pixels into different objects. The example is simplified, using monochromatic pixels and simple weights for demonstration purposes.
