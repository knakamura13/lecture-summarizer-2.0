Now here's Euler's theorem again. Let's look at this Euler's totient function for the case that we're going to use. We're going to have a pair of prime numbers P and Q. So we saw when N equals one prime number P, then Euler's theorem is the same as Fermat's little theorem. We're going to apply Euler's theorem for the case when capital N is the product of P and Q, where P and Q are both prime numbers. What is phi of N in this case? Why not go ahead and try to figure out what is phi of N for the case when N is P times Q for prime numbers P and Q. So we want to figure out how many numbers between 1 and P times Q are relatively prime to PQ.
