00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
 Let's pause for a quick quiz.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,860
 So what was the running time of the Bellman-Ford algorithm?

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,910
 And now if we run Bellman-Ford algorithm N times,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,192
 so we're running it for all N possible start vertices,

5
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:12,192
 what's the running time of this approach for the all pairs shortest path problem?
