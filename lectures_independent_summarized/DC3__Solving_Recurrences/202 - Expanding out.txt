Analyzing a recurrence relation T(N) = 4T(N/2) + O(N), the relation evolves by substitution into a form that reveals a geometric series when substituted I - 1 times. Recognizing the base case occurs at T(1), we set I equal to log_2(N), which simplifies the relation to evaluate the overall complexity. Key observations include that T(1) can be bounded by constant C and 4^(log_2(N)) is O(N^2). The geometric series, due to its increasing nature, is dominated by its last term, which simplifies to O(N). Consequently, the overall complexity of the recurrence is determined to be O(N^2), stemming from the geometric progression within the recursive structure.
