To prove that a sink component S implies that its complement S bar is a source component and vice versa, a claim about the connectivity of literals in a strongly connected component (SCC) is used. The claim states that if there's a path from literal alpha to beta, there is a corresponding path from beta bar to alpha bar. Applying this claim, for any two vertices (literals) alpha and beta in the sink component S, which are strongly connected, there are paths from alpha to beta and from beta to alpha. By the claim, there are paths from beta bar to alpha bar and from alpha bar to beta bar. This shows alpha bar and beta bar are strongly connected in their own SCC, S bar, signifying that complements of literals in an SCC are also strongly connected. Although this establishes that the complement of an SCC is another SCC, it does not directly demonstrate the sink-source relationship. However, it is a stepping stone towards proving that a sink SCC implies that its complement is a source SCC, and the reverse can also be proved using similar reasoning. The final part of showing a sink leads to a source and vice versa remains to be proven.
