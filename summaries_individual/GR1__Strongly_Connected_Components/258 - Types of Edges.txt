Edges in a DFS graph represent relationships between vertices, with black (explored) and blue edges (unexplored). The DFS "tree" might really be a forest with multiple components. Tree edges are black, linking reachable vertices such as B to A or A to D, with post order numbers increasing from the tail (D) to the head (A) of the edge. Blue edges are categorized as back, forward, or cross edges, with distinct properties. Back edges, like E to A or F to B, loop back from descendants to ancestors; their post order numbers decrease opposite to tree edges. Forward edges, like D to G, move down the tree; post order numbers here decrease similarly to tree edges. Cross edges, such as F to H, connect unrelated vertices; post order numbers decrease with these edges. The key distinction is that the post order number increases for back edges, but decreases for tree, forward, and cross edges.
