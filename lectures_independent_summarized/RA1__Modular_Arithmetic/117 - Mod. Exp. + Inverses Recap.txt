Reviewed modular arithmetic—X mod Y—and the polynomial-time modular exponentiation algorithm for repeated squaring, crucial for RSA algorithm with large bit-sized numbers X, Y, and N. Discussed multiplicative inverses, existing iff numbers are relatively prime (GCD of one), checking via Euclid's algorithm, and computing inverses with the extended Euclid algorithm. These concepts and algorithms are fundamental for RSA cryptosystem implementation.
