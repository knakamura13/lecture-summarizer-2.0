1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,545
 Now, let's suppose I want to show a reduction from colorings to SAT. How do I do it.

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,440
 Well if we reduce coloring to SAT,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,575
 what we're showing is that,

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,245
 if there is a polynomial time algorithm for SAT,

5
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:14,070
 then we can use it to get a polynomial time algorithm for colorings.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,540
 So what do we do. We suppose that there is a polynomial time algorithm for SAT.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,440
 And we're going to treat this algorithm like a black box.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,480
 What does it mean to treat this algorithm as a black box.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,220
 Well we don't know how the algorithm works,

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,105
 but we can use this as a basic subroutine.

11
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:31,020
 We can put in some input for SAT and we can get out

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,965
 some output and it takes polynomial time for that algorithm to run.

13
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:37,650
 And we're going to use this black box algorithm,

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,140
 as a subroutine to get a polynomial time algorithm for colorings problem.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,220
 So let's look at it pictorially.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,800
 So here's our black box algorithm for SAT.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,255
 We can give it some input and it produces some output.

18
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:51,915
 Either it gives us a solution,

19
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:53,115
 or it outputs no,

20
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:55,890
 if there's no solution for that particular input.

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,640
 Now, we want to use this black box algorithm or subroutine for

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,370
 satisfiability problem and we want to use it to

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,485
 construct an algorithm for the colorings problem.

24
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:09,145
 So this red box denotes our subroutine for the colorings problem.

25
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:11,325
 So the input to our colorings problem,

26
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:13,465
 is a particular I,

27
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:17,890
 which in this case is a graph and a number of colors K. Now,

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,990
 what we need to do, is define a transformation f. We have to show how to

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,280
 transform this input to

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,390
 the colorings problem and produce an input to the satisfiability problem.

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,730
 So we have to change this graph and there's number of colors into a boolean formula.

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,920
 Then we plug that boolean formula into

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,575
 our set solver and our set solver either gives us a solution,

34
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,370
 in this case it's an assignment,

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,030
 which satisfies this formula or it outputs no,

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,220
 there's no solution for this input.

37
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,590
 Now, we have to transform this solution into a solution to the original colorings input.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,025
 So we have defined another transformation which we denote is H.This H takes as input,

39
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,990
 a solution to our SAT input and it

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,090
 transforms it to get a solution to our original colorings instance.

41
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,980
 So if S is a solution to f(I),

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,460
 then h(s) is the solution to I.

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,235
 And if our SAT input had no solution,

44
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,560
 then we'll say that our colorings input had no solution.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:17,560
 So if we get out no we output no.
