Recall our basic recipe for designing a dynamic programming algorithm. The first step is always to define the sub-problem in words. Our first attempt is always to try the same problem on a prefix of the input. Therefore, we let K of I be the max value achievable using a subset of the first I objects. All we've changed is we've changed the set of objects available to us from the first N objects 1 through N to a subset of objects 1 through I. Our second step in our recipe for designing a dynamic programming algorithm is to find a recursive relation which expresses K of I the solution to the I sub-problem in terms of smaller sub-problems. In this case K 1 through K I minus 1.
