Vector coefficients in a polynomial A(x) can be separated into even and odd terms, creating A even(Y) and A odd(Y) polynomials with degrees N/2-1 if A(x) is of degree N-1. A(x) equals A even(X^2) plus X times A odd(X^2), demonstrating a divide-and-conquer strategy. This reduces the original polynomial problem into two subproblems of halved degrees, although evaluations still needed at squares of initial points, not halving the evaluation requirement like the degree reduction. The interplay of even-odd terms simplifies complexities of the larger polynomial.
