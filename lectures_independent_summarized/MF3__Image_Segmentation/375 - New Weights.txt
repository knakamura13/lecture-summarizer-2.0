L represents total pixel likelihoods for foreground (F) and background (B). Weight of partition F, B is sum of assigned vertices' likelihoods, corrected by a separation penalty for edges. New weight W' is similar but adds penalty instead of subtracting. Key relationship: W_F,B = L - W'_F,B. Thus, maximization of W is equivalent to minimization of W', turning our problem into a min instead of a max problem. All W' terms are positive. This converts the problem into a mean SD cut, solvable by max flow in flow networksâ€”maximize flow to find mean SD cut solution.
