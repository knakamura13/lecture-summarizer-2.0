Exploiting divide and conquer strategies similar to those used for multiplying large integers, which improve upon O(n^2) time complexity, we adapt these methods for polynomial multiplication by leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Given two polynomials, A(x) and B(x), both of maximum degree n-1 with coefficients A0 to An-1 and B0 to Bn-1, the objective is to calculate their product polynomial C(x). The degree of C(x) peaks at 2n-2, its coefficients ranging from C0 to C2n-2. Each coefficient of C(x), Ck, is the sum of the products of coefficients of A(x) and B(x) across all aligned terms contributing to the term degree k. Computing the coefficients vector for C(x) is essentially calculating the convolution of A and B. The approach fundamentally transforms the coefficient vectors of A and B to efficiently compute their convolution, thus attaining the coefficients of C(x) using FFT to harness better time efficiency in polynomial multiplication.
