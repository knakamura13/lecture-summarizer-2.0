Inverse FFT requires understanding FFT from a linear algebra perspective, where FFT is seen as matrix-vector multiplication. The polynomial A(X) at a point x_j is the sum of terms a_0 to a_n-1 times powers of x_j, which can be interpreted as an inner product of two vectors: one vector with powers of x_j and another with coefficients of A(X). FFT computes A(X) at n points, which means evaluating A(X) at x_0 to x_n-1. In matrix terms, the matrix rows are the powers of the x points, while the vector is formed from the coefficients of A(X). Thus, the first matrix row contains powers of x_0, the next row those of x_1, and so on up to x_n-1.
