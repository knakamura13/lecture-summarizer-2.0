1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
 Now let's prove the reverse implication.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,215
 So let's take an assignment to these original K literals and these auxiliary,

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,715
 K minus three variables which satisfy C prime.

4
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,190
 Let's prove that there is

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,550
 a satisfying assignment for C. What we'll do is we'll just ignore

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,190
 these auxiliary variables and we'll prove that

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,250
 these are settings where these original K literals,

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,510
 satisfies the original clause.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,840
 Now in order to satisfy this clause C,

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,560
 we just need to show that at least one of these literals is set to true.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,110
 Let's suppose that's not the case.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,245
 Suppose all of these K literals are set to false.

13
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:37,705
 Under this assumption, is it possible to satisfy C prime?

14
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,700
 We'll show it's not possible.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,730
 Now we're supposing we have an assignment which satisfy C prime.

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,070
 So it satisfies all of these clauses.

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,112
 Let's look at the first clause.

18
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:51,085
 Now we're supposing that a1 and a2 are set to false.

19
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,665
 So the first two literals are not satisfied.

20
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,160
 So the third literal must be satisfied.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,855
 That means Y1 must be set to true.

22
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:03,025
 That's the only way to satisfy this clause, under this assumption.

23
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,870
 Similarly, let's look at the second clause.

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,775
 What we're seeing Y1 is true.

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,155
 So this literal is not satisfied.

26
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,090
 Also a3, we're assuming is set to false.

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,775
 So this literal is not satisfied.

28
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:16,935
 So, we better satisfied this third literal, Y2.

29
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:19,250
 So, Y2 has to be set to true.

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,710
 Continuing in on, look at the penultimate clause.

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,826
 In order to satisfy this penultimate clause,

32
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:27,675
 we have to satisfy this literal.

33
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:30,920
 So, we have to set Yk-3 to be true.

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,740
 Now look at the last clause,

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,540
 where Yk-3 is set to true.

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,225
 So this literal is not satisfied.

37
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:43,655
 Similarly, these last two literals are not satisfied because they're set to false.

38
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:46,285
 So this clause is not satisfied.

39
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:49,425
 That means that C prime is not satisfied.

40
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,480
 That's a contradiction. We were assuming that this

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,030
 was assignment which satisfied C prime.

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,220
 So that means, that this assumption that all of

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,345
 these literals are set to false, is not true.

44
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:03,870
 So at least one of them must be set to true and therefore that literal satisfies

45
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,670
 this clause C. So if we just ignore the assignment to these auxiliary variables,

46
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:08,670
 then the setting for the original literals satisfies this original clause.
