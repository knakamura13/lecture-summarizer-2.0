1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,045
 The final tool that we'll need is manipulating polynomials.

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:07,420
 What we saw in the previous example is that 4 raised to

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,905
 the power log base 2 of n is the same as n squared.

4
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:14,635
 Now that example is quite straightforward but we're going to have

5
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:18,785
 other examples which arise such as three raised to the power log base 2n.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,370
 And we want to convert this into a polynomial.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,496
 So we want to convert this into n to the c for sum constant c and we want to figure out

8
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:28,930
 what is this constant c. So let's see

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,375
 the basic recipe for converting this into a polynomial.

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,135
 The key is that the base of this log is 2.

11
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,755
 So I want to change this base from 3 to 2.

12
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:43,490
 Well, 3 is the same as 2 raised to the power log base 2 of 3.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,390
 That's by the definition of log.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,495
 So let's substitute this in, to this expression.

15
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:54,700
 So we have 3 raised to the power log base 2n and then we replace 3 by this expression.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,555
 So we have 2 raised to the power log base 2 of 3

17
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:04,230
 raised to the power log base 2 of n. Notice these exponents multiply.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:10,100
 So this is the same as 2 raised to the power log base 2 of 3 times log base 2 of n. And

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,060
 we can rewrite this as 2 raised to

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,110
 power log base 2 of n and raised to the power log base 2 of 3.

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,860
 What we've done is just swapped these exponents.

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,695
 Now look at this inner quantity.

23
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:26,445
 That's just, n, so we have n raised to the power log base 2 of 3.

24
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:26,445
 So we see that this exponent c is log base 2 of 3.
