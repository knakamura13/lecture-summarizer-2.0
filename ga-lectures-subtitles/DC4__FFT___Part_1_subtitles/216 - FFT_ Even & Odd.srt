1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
 So given this vector of coefficients for this polynomial A of X,

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,660
 to find A even as the coefficients for

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,665
 the even terms and A odd as the coefficients for the odd terms.

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:14,940
 Then we can look at the polynomials defined by this vector of coefficients.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,660
 This vector A even defines this polynomial A even of

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,250
 Y. I have used a variable y to avoid confusion with A of X.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,225
 Notice that A 2 is the quadratic term in A of X,

8
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:28,785
 but in A even,

9
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:31,985
 it's the linear term since it's the second coefficient.

10
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:36,030
 And similarly A 4 is going to be the quadratic term.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,560
 Similarly this vector A odd defines this polynomial A odd of y.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,755
 Notice that the degree of these two polynomials is N over two minus one.

13
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:47,910
 So we took a polynomial A of X of degree N minus

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,975
 one and we defined a pair of polynomials of degree N over two minus one.

15
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:58,480
 How does a polynomial A of X relate to the polynomial A even and the polynomial A odd?

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,250
 Well notice if I take the polynomial A even and I evaluated at the Y equals X squared,

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,790
 then I get the even terms of the polynomial A of X.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,850
 Similarly if I evaluate the polynomial A odd at the point Y equals X squared.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,365
 Then I get the odd terms except it's off by one in the exponent.

20
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,110
 So I multiply by X.

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,440
 So A of X is equal to A even evaluated at the point X

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,245
 squared plus X times A odd evaluated at the point X square.

23
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:32,670
 At this point you just start to see

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,755
 the semblance of the idea of the divide and conquer approach.

25
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:39,075
 We started with a polynomial of degree N minus one.

26
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:43,140
 And now we have defined a pair of polynomials of degree N over 2 minus one.

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,640
 So we went down from N to N over two and we got two subproblems,

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,080
 A even and A odd.

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,610
 And if we want A at a point X,

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,240
 then it suffices to know A even and A odd at the point X squared.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,100
 So we've got two subproblems of half the size.

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,640
 Now the degree of this polynomial A of X went down from N minus

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,270
 one to N over two minus one for these two smaller polynomials.

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,120
 However if we need a of X at two endpoints,

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,755
 we still need A even and A odd at

36
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:15,410
 two endpoints the square of these original two endpoints.

37
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,935
 So the degree of these polynomials went down by a factor of two.

38
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,860
 But the number of points we need to evaluate

39
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,465
 them at hasn't gone down by a factor of two yet.

40
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:23,465
 This is where we're going to use the plus minus.
