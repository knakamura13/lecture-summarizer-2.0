Reduction of 3SAT problem to subset-sum problem using a formula with three variables (X1, X2, X3) and four clauses. Each variable is assigned a pair of numbers (V1/V1', V2/V2', V3/V3') and each clause a pair (S1/S1', up to S4/S4'), totaling 15 numbers to define subset-sum input. Numbers are seven digits, representing variables and clauses. Digits 1-3 correspond to variables, 4-7 to clauses. To ensure subset-sum solution reflects a variable's Boolean value (true/false), digit one is '1' for V1/V1' and t, and similarly for others. This forces the solution to include exactly one from V1/V1', ensuring a sum of '1' and mapping correctly to variable assignments. The structure guarantees that any subset-sum solution corresponds to a potential satisfying assignment by reflecting the truth assignment of variables within the subset.
