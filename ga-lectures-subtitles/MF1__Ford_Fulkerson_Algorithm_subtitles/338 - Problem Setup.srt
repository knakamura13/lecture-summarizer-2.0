1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,755
 The general setting is that we're sending supply from

2
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:06,330
 vertex s to vertex t. Now, what does this supply?

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,730
 The supply might be things like Internet traffic,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,390
 or it might be a product.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,200
 Now, the network is specified by a directed graph,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,702
 and we have a designated start vertex s,

7
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:19,740
 and we have a designated end vertex t. And our goal is to maximize

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,480
 the amount of supply sent from s to t along the edges of this network,

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,040
 but we don't want to exceed the capacities of the edges.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,810
 So, for each edge we have a capacity of that edge.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,300
 If you think of supply as an example such as

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,975
 Internet traffic then the capacity corresponds to the bandwidth of the link.

13
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:41,820
 If you think of a more physical example such as supply being oil,

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,260
 then we're maximizing the amount of oil sent from point s to point t in this network.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,135
 And then the edges correspond to actual pipes,

16
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:51,135
 and then these numbers correspond to the capacity of these pipes.
