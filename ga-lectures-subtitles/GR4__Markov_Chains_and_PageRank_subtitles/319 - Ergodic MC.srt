1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,630
 These are the two key properties of a Markov chain,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,460
 that is aperiodic and irreducible.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,655
 Recall that aperiodic means that the underlying graph is not bipartite.

4
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:10,960
 How do we get around it?

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,380
 We add self-loops, and that ensures that the graph

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,160
 is not bipartite and has no aperiodic structure.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,975
 Irreducible means that it has one strongly connected component.

8
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:23,580
 How do we ensure that? By making sure that the graph is fully connected.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,231
 All pairs of states can get between each other in one step,

10
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:29,960
 there's an edge between every pair of vertices.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,326
 Now, a Markov chain which is a periodic and irreducible is called the Ergodic,

12
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,665
 and that's the key property.

13
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:38,220
 In Ergodic Markov chain has nice properties.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,640
 A Markov chain with these two properties has a stationary distribution pi and is unique.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,790
 There is exactly one stationary distribution.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,885
 Moreover, we have the following nice property for the raised to the power

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,295
 T. For some big enough T then the matrix looks like pi,

18
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:58,745
 pi, pi, every row is pi.

19
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01,455
 What does that mean? That means regardless of where we start.

20
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,165
 So, we starting at one of these rows,

21
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:06,210
 and then we're doing T steps of our random walk.

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,610
 We're going to reach this distribution pi.

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,410
 So no matter the starting state,

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,310
 we eventually reach the unique stationary distribution pi.

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,160
 This was the same scenario that happened for our simple example

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,815
 on four states for the 6210 example.

27
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:24,585
 So in other words, we always reach pi no matter where we start.

28
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,770
 How is page rank going to be defined?

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,800
 Well, page rank is going to be defined by looking at a Markov chain on the web graph, so,

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,803
 we're going to do a random walk on the web graph, the sites,

31
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,975
 the vertices are going to be web pages,

32
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:39,750
 the edges are going to correspond to hyperlinks.

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,880
 Now, we're going to have some technicalities to ensure that

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,225
 the underlying Markov chain is aperiodic and irreducible.

35
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:48,425
 How are we going to solve them? Exactly as we mentioned earlier.

36
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:52,605
 We're going to add self loops and we're going at it to be fully connected and then

37
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:57,585
 the page rank is going to be defined as the stationary distribution of this Markov chain.

38
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:58,995
 Since it's Ergodic, there's

39
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:02,800
 a unique stationary distribution and no matter where we start as random walk,

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,240
 we'll always reach this unique stationary distribution.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,040
 So, it's well-defined, the stationary distribution will correspond to the page rank.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,220
 So, our measure of the importance of a web page will be

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,725
 related to the probability of ending at that web page.

44
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,845
 We start a random walk from any state,

45
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,620
 we run the random walk for many steps.

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,830
 What's the probability we end at a particular web page J?

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,900
 That corresponds to the page rank,

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:27,900
 the importance of the web page J.
