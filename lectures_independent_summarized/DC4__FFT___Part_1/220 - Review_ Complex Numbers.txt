Complex numbers, denoted as Z = a + bi with real part A and imaginary part B, underpin the evaluation of the polynomial A(x). They are represented in the complex plane with two axes for real and imaginary components, respectively. Polar coordinates (R, theta), where R is the magnitude and theta is the angle to the horizontal axis, offer an alternative, useful depiction of complex numbers especially for multiplicative operations. Conversion between Cartesian (a, b) and polar (R, theta) coordinates involves trigonometry, with A = R * cos(theta) and B = R * sin(theta). Another potent representation is provided through Euler's formula, e^(i*theta) = cos(theta) + i*sin(theta), which allows expressing complex numbers compactly as Z = R * e^(i*theta). Euler's formula is proven via Taylor series expansions for the exponential, cosine, and sine functions. This foundational understanding of complex numbers facilitates the development of a simple yet elegant final algorithm for polynomial evaluation.
