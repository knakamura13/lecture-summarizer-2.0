00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,325
 Now here's our example from the previous slide.

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:04,590
 Here's the illustration of the feasible region.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,170
 First off, we have the non-negative constraints defined by the axes.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,780
 So in the upper right quadrant,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,865
 the first constraint says that x plus y is that most one.

6
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,845
 That's illustrated by this line,

7
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:18,110
 and we're looking at the points on this side of this line.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,340
 The next constraint says that 3x plus 2y is at least six.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,835
 That's defined by this line,

10
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,045
 and we're considering this half space.

11
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:29,305
 Now notice that the two half spaces defined by these two constraints don't intersect.

12
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,570
 So there are no points x,

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,115
 y satisfying both these constraints while maintaining the non-negativity constraint.

14
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,245
 Hence, the feasible region is empty.

15
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,900
 So there are no points satisfying these constraints.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,190
 So this objective function,

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,285
 this LP, is undefined.

18
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:46,995
 Now notice that infeasibility had nothing to do with the objective function.

19
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:50,880
 Regardless of the objective function for these constraints,

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:50,880
 the LP will be infeasible.
