1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 This motivates the notion of variable edges.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,350
 If I had an edge from this vertex corresponding to

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,455
 X_1 to this vertex corresponding to X_1-bar,

4
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:14,395
 then I ensure that any independent set contains this vertex or this vertex or neither,

5
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:17,002
 but it cannot contain both vertices.

6
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:21,850
 And therefore, I'll never try to set X_1 to be true and X_1 to be false.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,275
 In general, for each of the variables X_i,

8
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,280
 I'm going to add edges between all copies

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,885
 corresponding to X_i and all copies corresponding to X_i-bar.

10
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:36,820
 This will ensure that our independent set corresponds to a valid assignment and then

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,325
 the clause edges will ensure that our independent set

12
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:43,420
 corresponds to an assignment which satisfies all of the clauses.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:43,420
 Let's take a look at a specific example to illustrate this construction.
