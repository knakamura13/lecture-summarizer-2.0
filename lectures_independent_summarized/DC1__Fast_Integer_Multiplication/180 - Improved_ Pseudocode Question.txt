Developed an enhanced multiplication algorithm named Fast Multiply, improving the previous order n square time methodology by modifying the end section. Maintains original setup: inputs two n-bit integers (x and y), outputs their product. Inputs split into two halves, XL, XR for x and YL, YR for y. Fast Multiply recursively computes three products—XL times YL (A), XR times YR (B), and (XL + XR) times (YL + YR) (C)—instead of four. Applies Gauss's technique for combining results: multiplies A by 2^n, adds product of (C - A - B) by 2^(n/2), and adds B. Outputs Z, the final product, significantly reducing subproblems to three.
