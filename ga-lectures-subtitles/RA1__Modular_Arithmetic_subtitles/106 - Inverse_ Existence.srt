1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,820
 so when exactly are their multiplicative

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,130
 inverses or not the general theorem is

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,830
 that X inverse mod an exists if and only

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,969
 if X and n have no common divisor so the

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,540
 greatest common divisor is one GC D

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,580
 stands for a greatest common divisor so

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,730
 if they're both even then 2 is a divisor

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,730
 of both so the GCD is at least 2 might

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,519
 be bigger what's at least 2 now just

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,130
 some terminology when the greatest GCD

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,800
 of X and n is 1 so they have no common

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,260
 divisor then we say that X and n are

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,390
 relatively prime with respect to each

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,920
 other they feel like primes to each

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,250
 other

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,340
 for instance 9 and 14 neither one is

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,440
 prime but with respect to each other

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,510
 they have no common divisors so they

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,730
 feel like Prime's to each other so the

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,860
 theorem says that if these numbers are

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,989
 prime relatively prime to each other

22
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,510
 then there is an inverse but if they

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,520
 have a common divisor then there is no

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,559
 inverse let's look at why this theorem

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,149
 holds but before we get into it let's

26
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,739
 look at some basic properties about

27
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:01,739
 inverses
