Conducted a Depth-First Search (DFS) on an 8-vertex directed graph starting at vertex B. Vertices encountered were explored in alphabetical order. B, as the starting point, received the initial pre-order number. The exploration followed B-A-D-E-G, assigning pre-order numbers sequentially. G had no outgoing edges, resulting in a backtrack and it receiving the first post-order number. A non-tree edge from E to A was marked as a blue edge since A was previously visited. After exploring all of E's edges, backtrack and post-order numbering continued from E to D, then to H, with G-H also marked as a blue edge since G was visited. Post-order numbers were assigned to the vertices upon backtracking completion. Then exploration proceeded from B to C and F, with F-B and F-H also designated as blue edges due to prior visits. Following this final subtree's exploration and post-order numbering, the DFS concluded.
