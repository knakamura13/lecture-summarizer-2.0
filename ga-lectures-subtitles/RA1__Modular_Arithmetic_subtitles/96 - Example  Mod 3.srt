1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 Look at a simple example to make sure everybody

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,690
 understands the concept of modular arithmetic.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,385
 Let's look at numbers modulo three.

4
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:08,970
 When you look at the number mod three,

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,670
 there are three possible values, zero, one, or two.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,150
 Hence, there are three equivalence classes for the numbers modulo three.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,460
 Now we set three mod three is also zero.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,925
 Same with six, nine, and so on.

9
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:24,945
 All the multiples of three.

10
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:28,750
 Similarly four mod three is one.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,095
 Same with seven, and 10, and so on.

12
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,400
 Finally, five mod three is two.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,610
 Same for eight, and 11, and so on.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,370
 But look, we can also go negative.

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,545
 What is negative three mod three?

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,105
 Well, negative three divided by three is negative one,

17
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,480
 and the remainder is zero.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,570
 So negative three mod three is zero.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,320
 Same for negative six,

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,500
 negative nine, and so on.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,885
 Now if I look at negative two mod three,

22
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:04,965
 then it is one. Why is that?

23
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:10,180
 X mod N equals R means that when I divide X by N,

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,700
 I get a remainder of R. What does that mean?

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,915
 That means that there are some multiple of N,

26
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,415
 so I can take Q copies of N,

27
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:21,640
 and I have to add an R, and I end up with X.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,050
 Now look at negative two mod three.

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,810
 That is one. Why is that?

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,290
 So if I look at negative two divided by N,

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,970
 what do I get? I get negative one.

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,145
 So negative two, I have Q equals negative one times three.

33
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,285
 So there's negative three plus one,

34
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:46,660
 so, R equals one.

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,350
 And I end up with two.

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,080
 So the remainder is one.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,245
 So negative two mod three is one.

38
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,785
 Similarly, negative five mod three is one.

39
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,930
 Negative eight mod three is one as well.

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,155
 Finally, negative one mod three is two.

41
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,490
 Same with negative four mod three is two,

42
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,626
 and negative seven, and so on.

43
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:12,190
 So these three equivalence classes all of these numbers,

44
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,110
 negative nine, zero, nine,

45
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,635
 are all the same with respect to modulo three.

46
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:19,905
 They're all congruent mod three.

47
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:23,570
 These numbers are congruent mod three.

48
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:23,570
 These numbers are congruent mod three.
