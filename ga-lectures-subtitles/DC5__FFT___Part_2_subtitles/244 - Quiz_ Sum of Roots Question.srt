00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 Let's take another quiz on some basic properties of the roots of unity.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,140
 Let's consider even n. And let's look at the sum of the nth roots of unity.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,765
 So let's take omegas sub n to the zero power,

4
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:13,035
 plus omega sub n to the first power,

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:14,565
 plus omega sub n squared,

6
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:17,605
 and so on, up to omega sub n to the n - 1.

7
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:17,605
 What does this sum equal?
