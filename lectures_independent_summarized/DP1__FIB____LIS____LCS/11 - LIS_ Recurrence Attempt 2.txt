Defining longest increasing subsequence(length LIS) L(i) which includes ai, get 1 for ai, and add max length LIS before ai where elements are smaller than ai. Only consider earlier indices j where aj < ai for appending ai to form L(i) = L(j) + 1. i must be after j in the array. With the recurrence relation for L(i) established, we can describe a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to solve the problem, which will include pseudocode and runtime analysis.
