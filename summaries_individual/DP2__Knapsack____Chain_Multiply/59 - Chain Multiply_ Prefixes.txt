Dynamic programming algorithm for matrix chain multiplication problem begins by defining subproblems as the min. cost of computing the product of the first i matrices. Recurrence formulation involves splitting the chain at index i to examine costs of left (product of A1 to Ai) and right child (Ai+1 to An). Initially considering prefixes, further inspection reveals that intermediate computations involve substrings from index i to j. This observation necessitates a revision of the subproblem definition to account for substrings rather than just prefixes or suffixes. This change aims to capture the true nature of the problem for developing an accurate and efficient dynamic programming solution.
