Examining the Web graph, a huge graph with web pages as vertices and directed hyperlinks as edges, where a page X may link to Y without reciprocity. The importance of a page, its rank Ï€(X), needs a precise mathematical definition with natural interpretation, similar to stationary distribution in Markov chains but not yet related. To discuss page relationships, define "out of X" as the set of web pages that X hyperlinks to and "in of X" as those linking to web page X. These notational conventions help us quantify web page importance within the Web graph's structure.
