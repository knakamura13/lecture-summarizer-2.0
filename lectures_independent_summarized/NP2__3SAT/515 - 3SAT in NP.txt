3SAT problem proven to be in class ϵNP by demonstrating efficient verifiability of solutions. For a given input f and proposed true/false assignment for n variables, process entails checking each clause C—max three literals each. Verification time per clause is constant, hence for M clauses, verification takes O(M) time total. Assignment satisfaction of all clauses implies the entire formula f is satisfied, confirming 3SAT's placement in ϵNP.
