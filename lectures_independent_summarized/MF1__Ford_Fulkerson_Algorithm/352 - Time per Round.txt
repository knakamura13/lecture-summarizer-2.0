Ford-Fulkerson algorithm efficiency analyzed. Time for one round (steps 2-5): update residual network, check for st-path, augment flow. Residual network update takes order N time due to path length ≤ N-1 edges. st-path checked using DFS/BFS, linear time order N+M; bound by order M if edges ≥ N-1. Augmenting flow also order N time. One round time is determined by st-path check, order N. Total running time is order N per round, multipled by capital C (max flow increase). Thus, Ford-Fulkerson algorithm requires time order N*C.
