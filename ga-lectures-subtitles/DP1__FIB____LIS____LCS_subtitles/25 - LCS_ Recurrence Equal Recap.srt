1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,482
 So let's recap our recurrence for the case where X_i equals Y_j,

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:06,670
 the last characters are the same and the two prefixes.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,505
 Here, we have three possibilities

4
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,800
 and we're going to take the best of the three, therefore, we take the max.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,103
 We have L of i minus one j,

6
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:19,357
 which corresponds to dropping X_i, L of i,

7
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:24,420
 j minus one which corresponds to dropping Y_j or we include X_i,

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,920
 Y_j the common character at the end and we get a plus one for that,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,740
 and then we take the optimal solution to this smaller sub problem L of i minus one,

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,470
 j minus one, we take the max of these three.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,345
 Some of you may have noticed that in fact,

12
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:40,650
 the recurrence, in this case,

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,645
 can be simplified even further.

14
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:44,670
 We only need to consider the last case,

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,200
 where we append on X_i,

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,745
 Y_j the common character onto the end.

17
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,580
 Let me give you some brief intuition about why that's the case.

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,365
 Notice, if this solution doesn't include either of these characters,

19
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,520
 then we can just add them on and we get a longer.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,415
 So, therefore, it wasn't optimal length.

21
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:06,600
 So it's got to include either X_i or Y_j.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,770
 Now, it may be the case that X_i

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,640
 is matched with some earlier recurrence of that character.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,185
 In this case, it's Y_1,

25
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:19,155
 but any solution which we obtain by

26
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:22,770
 matching X_i with an earlier recurrence of that character,

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,350
 we could have obtained Y instead matching X_i with this latter solution.

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,870
 Any sub sequence which occurs in that smaller prefix of Y,

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,720
 also is a sub sequence in this larger prefix of Y, okay?

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,310
 It's a super sign of it.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,610
 Therefore, we only need to consider this case and we get

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,870
 this simpler recurrence for this case where they're equal, okay?

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,870
 And this completes our definition of the recurrence.
