1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
 Now once again we have this subgraph T prime which is obtained by taking

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,945
 the tree T adding in this edge e star and taking out the edge e prime.

3
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,840
 We've just showed that T prime is a tree and once again,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,850
 notice that we could have removed any edge of

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,340
 this cycle and we would have attained a tree.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,270
 But now we want to show that it's a minimum spanning tree.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,860
 How do we show it's of minimum way?

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,375
 Well you know that T is an MST,

9
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,940
 so we know that the weight of T is a minimum over all trees.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,750
 So to show that T prime is a minimum spanning tree,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,900
 we have to show that the weight of T prime equals the weight of T. What do

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,200
 we know about the weight of each star compared to that of e prime?

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,090
 Well, we know that the weight of each star is minimum over all edges cross the cut,

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,140
 e prime also crosses the cut as the s spur therefore,

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,370
 the way to e star is the most that of the weight of e prime.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,500
 Now what is the weight of T prime?

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,770
 It's the weight of T plus the weight of e star

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,365
 and then finally minus the weight of e prime.

19
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:03,825
 The weight of e star is the most the weight of e prime so this part is almost zero.

20
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:07,200
 So this whole thing is at most the weight of T. So we've shown that

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,632
 the weight of T prime is the most of the weight of T T is minimum weight,

22
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:14,220
 therefore T prime is also a minimum weight and in fact,

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,320
 the weight of T prime must equal the weight of

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,450
 T. So the weight of e star must equal the weight of e prime.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,390
 Otherwise we retrain the new tree T prime which is strictly smaller weight than t,

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,795
 which would contradict the fact that T is an MST.

27
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,780
 So all these edges of T which cross this cut,

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,470
 must be of exactly the same weight as e star otherwise,

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,425
 we can obtain a new tree which is of smaller weight.

30
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,990
 That completes the proof of the cut property.

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,820
 Now the key idea that I want to stress,

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,420
 is that I can take a tree T and I add an edge into

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,400
 that tree so I take T union e star that creates a cycle.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,870
 Now I can remove any edge of that cycle and I get a new tree T prime.

35
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,380
 Now that's the idea that I wanted to get from the proof of the cut property.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,580
 The other idea I want you to get,

37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,445
 is the idea from the statement of the cut property.

38
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:04,080
 From the statement of the cut property,

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,320
 I want you to get the idea that a minimum weight edge across the cut is part of a MST.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,810
 Those are the two key ideas I want you to get from the statement of

41
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:12,810
 the cut property and the proof idea of the cut property.
