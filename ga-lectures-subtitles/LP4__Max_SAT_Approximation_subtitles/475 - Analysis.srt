00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,235
 Going back to our analysis from earlier,

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:05,730
 we're looking at the probability that this Jth clause is satisfied.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,045
 This equals one minus the probability it's unsatisfied,

4
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:11,040
 which is the product over I,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,395
 from one to K of one minus YI hat star.

6
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:16,140
 Now, we can apply the arithmetic mean,

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,260
 geometric mean and inequality.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,800
 Now, we can apply the arithmetic mean,

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,445
 geometric mean and inequality.

10
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,615
 The arithmetic mean is one over K times the sum

11
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:28,475
 of I going from one to K of one minus YI hat star.

12
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,930
 And then we're raising it to the Kth power,

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,250
 since we dropped that one over Kth root of the geometric mean.

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,120
 Now, the inequality said that the geometric mean is at most the arithmetic mean.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,110
 But we're doing negative of this so we get that it's at least.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,420
 Now, we can simplify this a bit.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,330
 We can do the sum over each of these terms separately.

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,005
 And the first term is a sum over I from one to K of one.

19
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,380
 That's simply K. So,

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,330
 that divides by this one over K. So,

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,090
 we get one for the first term.

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,230
 So, we get a one for this first one,

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,690
 and the second term becomes one over K times the sum over I from one to K,

24
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,465
 of YI hat star.

25
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:13,730
 And then we get this whole quantity raised to the Kth power still.

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,030
 Now we're in business,

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,270
 because we have this sum over these YI hat stars.

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,325
 Now, if you recall before,

29
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:23,010
 we had this constraint from the linear program.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,745
 It said that if each of these variables was set to false,

31
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:29,215
 so each of these Ys was set to zero,

32
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:32,610
 then the corresponding ZJ must be zero.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,390
 Now, this is actually a linear program,

34
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,690
 so we don't have this integral constrains.

35
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:43,965
 So, we simply know that the sum of these Ys is at least this real number Z.

36
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,755
 But, we still have this inequality,

37
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:48,660
 and our goal is to relate this probability that

38
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,560
 this clause is satisfied to this quantity ZJ hat star.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,320
 So, we can apply this inequality,

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,480
 plug it in, and we can drop these Ys and get the Z.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,255
 Now, this is at least.

42
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:04,530
 Then we're doing a negative, and then another negative.

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,850
 So, we get that this is at least one minus the quantity,

44
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,340
 one minus the ZJ hat star over K,

45
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,400
 all raised to the Kth power.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,790
 So, we replace the sum over Ys by ZJ hat star.

47
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,140
 Now, we have to do a bit of calculus to simplify this.

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,140
 What we want to do is we want to move this ZJ outside of this Kth power.
