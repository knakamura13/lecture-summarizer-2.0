1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
 So here was our first idea.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,765
 We set the rank of a page X to be the number of links into the page X.

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:10,625
 So pi of X is the in degree of x.

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,910
 Now what's the obvious problems with this?

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,690
 Well, here's a simple example.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,195
 Let's suppose that Georgia Tech has a webpage which lists all the faculty,

7
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,630
 okay that's probably true,

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,435
 and the faculty list is probably like a thousand long.

9
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:26,155
 One of those is going to link to my webpage.

10
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:30,350
 So one out of a thousand of these links links to my webpage.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,795
 Now let's suppose that Georgia Tech's front page or the COCs front page

12
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:38,270
 has only five links on it and one of those happens to be the kishore's webpage.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,925
 Now in the current measure of the rank of a page X,

14
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:45,800
 I get a plus one for this link and Kishore gets a plus one for this link.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,380
 So both of those links count the same for us.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,780
 Now that doesn't seem so fair.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,200
 This is one out of a thousand,

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,650
 this is one out of five.

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,825
 So how do we get around it.

20
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:57,100
 Well, the obvious way is to scale it by the number of links.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,150
 Now the natural solution to this problem is if

22
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,630
 George Tech's webpage has a thousand links and one of them goes to

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,780
 my webpage then I get one out of a thousand and if

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,290
 Georgia Tech's front page has five links and one of those is to Kishore,

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,185
 then Kishore gets one-fifth of a citation.

26
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:16,240
 And in general if a page Y has these many outgoing links,

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,690
 then each webpage is going to get one over the number of outgoing links of a citation.

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,348
 So Georgia Tech's faculty list webpage has a thousand links let's say,

29
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:29,300
 so I'm going to get one over thousand of a citation.

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,460
 This webpage has five links, one to kishore's,

31
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,460
 so kishore is going to get one-fifth of a citation.
