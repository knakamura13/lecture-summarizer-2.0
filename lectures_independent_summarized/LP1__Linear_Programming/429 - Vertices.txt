Specify vertices of a feasible region in a convex polyhedron by identifying the n constraints met with equality and ensuring the point also satisfies the other m constraints. The max number of vertices is given by the combinatorial number (n+m choose n), denoting exponential growth in n. Neighbors of a vertex, defined by exchanging one satisfied constraint for another, have an upper bound of n*m possible neighbors.
