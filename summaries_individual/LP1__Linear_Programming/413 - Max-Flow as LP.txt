Directed graph G w/ pos. capacities for edges defines the max flow prob. Linear program (LP) with m variables, each representing an edge's flow. Objective to max total flow from source vertex S, by summing flows over outgoing edges from S. Must satisfy constraints: flow on edge non-neg; can't exceed edge capacity. Flow conservation: inflow equals outflow for internal vertices (except S and T). LP formulation powerful for max flow, considering linear obj. function and constraints, easily adaptable for solving variants of the max flow problem.
