Studying RSA cryptosystem math; involves simple concepts with proper math background. Focus on Modular Arithmetic, understanding multiplicative inverses within it, and applying Euclid's GCD algorithm. Covering Fermat's Little Theorem to explain RSA algorithm's design. Discussing primality testing to distinguish prime numbers from composites, utilizing Fermat's Little Theorem. Upon mastering primality testing, the course will proceed to generating random primes, a crucial RSA component. Completing this will end RSA algorithm discussion. Ready to explore RSA-related algorithms.
