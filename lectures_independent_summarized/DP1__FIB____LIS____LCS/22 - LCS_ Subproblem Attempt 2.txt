Revised subproblem for sequences involves using two indices, i and j, to account for different prefix lengths in sequences x and y. A two-dimensional table will be used, where i and j vary from 0 to n, to represent the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between prefixes xi and yj. L(i, j) defines the LCS length for the first i characters of x and the first j characters of y. Base cases are set for i=0 or j=0, where LCS length is 0 because one sequence is empty. These foundations pave the way for defining a recurrence relation for the LCS problem.
