00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 In this lecture, we'll look at an application of

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,755
 max flow to a problem from computer vision,

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,485
 known as Image Segmentation.

4
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:08,830
 We're given an image, such as this one,

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,745
 and our goal is to separate the image into objects.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,040
 The easier tests that we're going to look at is to

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,965
 simply separate the image into foreground and background.

8
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:16,965
 For example, in this image we want to discern the triangle from the rest of the image.
