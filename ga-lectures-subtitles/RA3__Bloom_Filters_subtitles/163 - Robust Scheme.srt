1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,985
 So now we have k hash functions instead of just one,

2
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:05,449
 h1, h2, up to hk.

3
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:08,535
 We're going to initialize our hash table at H,

4
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:10,490
 capital H to all zeroes.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,240
 So all of the bits, the n bits of H are set to zero.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,690
 How do we do an insertion?

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,410
 How do we add an element X?

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,740
 A possible password into our dictionary S of unacceptable passwords.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,880
 Previously we computed this hash value H of X and we set that bit to 1.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,340
 What are we going to do now?

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,355
 Now we compute the K hash values and we set all of those K bits to 1.

12
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:36,975
 So we go through the hash functions 1 through K,

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,915
 and then we compute it's I'th hash value,

14
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,450
 and we set this bit to 1.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,595
 It might already be 1 as before,

16
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:49,770
 but we always change bits from 0 to 1 just like before. How do we do a query?

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,015
 How do we check whether an element X was inserted into our dictionary S?

18
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:56,790
 Well, we compute it's K hash values and we check

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,870
 whether all of those K bits are set to 1 or not.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,160
 If all of those K bits are set to 1,

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,160
 then our best guess is that X was inserted into

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,514
 the database S. If any of those are still 0,

23
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:12,600
 then we're guaranteed that X was not inserted into the database.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,730
 So let's write that out more precisely.

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,760
 If for all of those K hash values

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,785
 the hash function at those K bits is set to 1, then we output yes.

27
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:26,640
 We believe that this element X is in the database S.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,682
 If any of these K bits is still 0,

29
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:29,682
 then we're guaranteed that this element X is not in the database. So we output no.
