DFS on a directed graph locates a vertex in a source SCC by identifying the vertex with the highest post order number. To find a vertex in a sink SCC, invert the graph: reverse all edges. This process flips the source and sink SCCs. If vertices V and W are strongly connected in graph G, they remain so in the reversed graph GR. The meta graph of SCCs in G is a DAG, and reversing edges changes the topological ordering. Run DFS on GR; the vertex with the highest post order number will be in a source SCC of GR and a sink SCC of G. This identifies vertices in sink SCCs of G and facilitates finding SCCs in topological order, progressing from right to left.
