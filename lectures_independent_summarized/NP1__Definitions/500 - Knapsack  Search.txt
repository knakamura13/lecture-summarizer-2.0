Exploring a variation of the knapsack problem as a search issue, input parameters include item weights (W1-Wn), values (V1-Vn), and total capacity (B), mirroring the original problem. A new parameter, goal value (g), modifies the objective from maximizing total value to determining if a subset exists that at least meets this goal without exceeding capacity B. If no such subset exists, output "NO," defining the search problem's solution. If the knapsack search version is solvable in polynomial time, so is the original optimization problem. This is achieved through binary search on g within the sum of all values (V), with the number of binary search rounds capped by log V, implying a polynomial time complexity in solving the optimization counterpart to the search problem. The input size, determined by log V, ensures the binary search's polynomial efficiency.
