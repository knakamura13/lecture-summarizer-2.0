1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
 Now, how do you specify the vertices of the feasible region?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,185
 Well, let's take a look back at our simple two dimensional example.

3
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:08,970
 How do I specify this vertex of this polygon?

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,765
 It satisfies these two lines with equality.

5
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:18,395
 The first line is X1 equals 300 and the second line is X1plus 3X2 equals 700.

6
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:22,645
 Now, satisfying these two constraints with equality specifies this point,

7
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:27,000
 but then I have to check that this point satisfies the other inequalities.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,085
 So in general, in n dimensional space,

9
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:32,595
 a vertex of this convex polyhedron is specified

10
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:36,945
 by specifying the end constraints that you satisfy with equality,

11
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:41,250
 and then we have to check that the remaining m constraints are still satisfied.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,840
 Now we can get a trivial upper bound on the number of vertices of this convex polyhedron,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,395
 we have to specify the constraints that are satisfied with equality.

14
00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:52,195
 There are n plus m constraints to choose from.

15
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:56,307
 So the number of vertices is most n plus m, choose n,

16
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,920
 this is exponential in n. So in the worst case,

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,080
 there are a huge number of vertices in this convex polyhedron,

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,630
 in this feasible region.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,205
 Now for a particular vertex,

20
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:07,075
 how many neighbors does it have?

21
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,825
 Can we get an upper bound on the number of neighbors for a specific vertex?

22
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:13,230
 Well, neighbor would correspond to swapping out

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,980
 one constraint with equality with a different constraint.

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,960
 So we have n choices for which one we swap out,

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,160
 and then we have m choices for which when we swap in.

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,160
 So the number of neighbors for a specific vertex is at most, n times m.
