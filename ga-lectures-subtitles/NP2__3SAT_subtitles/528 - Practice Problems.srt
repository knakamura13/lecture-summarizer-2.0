00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
 Now that you've seen your first NP completeness proof,

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,460
 the fact that three SAT is NP complete.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,875
 There are a few relevant practice problems from the text book that you can try now.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,026
 In problem 8.3, they consider a variant of SAT,

5
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:16,635
 called stingy SAT, and you want to prove that stingy SAT is NP complete.

6
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:20,915
 In problem 8.8, you consider exact 4-SAT.

7
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:23,648
 This means that every class has exactly four literals,

8
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,600
 not at most four literals but exactly four literals in every class.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:27,600
 And you want to prove that exact 4-SAT is
