00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,935
 Here's a directed graph on 12 vertices.

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:06,090
 Let's go ahead and mark the strongly connected components in this graph,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,420
 to make sure everybody understands the definition of SCCs.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,030
 And then we can dive into some interesting properties of strongly connected points.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,860
 First off, how many strongly connected components does this graph have?

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:18,860
 And now can you mark what are the strongly connected components in this graph?
