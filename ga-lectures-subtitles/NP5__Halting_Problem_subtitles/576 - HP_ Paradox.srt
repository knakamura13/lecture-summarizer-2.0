1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,093
 So consider the following evil program,

2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:04,920
 it's evil in the sense that Terminator algorithm that we

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,305
 assumed existed is going to fail on this program.

4
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:10,540
 This new program that I'm going define now.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,030
 I'm going to call Harmful.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,965
 Harmful has one input J.

7
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:17,560
 First line of harmful is an if statement.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,805
 We run this Terminator Algorithm which we assumed existed on input J and J.

9
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,850
 So we use this input for the harmful program.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,160
 As the program P and the input I for the Terminator algorithm.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,530
 Now Terminator returns true or false.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,460
 Now if it returns true then I'm going to go to one. So I have this loop.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,565
 If Terminator returns false then I simply exit the procedure.

14
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:44,520
 Now why did I call this procedure harmful.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,450
 While this was just a reference to Dijkstra's article from 1968,

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,110
 which was titled GoTo statement is considered Harmful.

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,460
 Anyways I'm allowed to use whatever

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,760
 Programming language I want and any programming style I want.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,880
 So I choose to use this GoTo statement.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,200
 It's going to make the loop more apparent in the algorithm.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,480
 Let's summarize what we just did.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,870
 We assume the existence of

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,605
 this Algorithm Terminator which solves the halting problem on every input.

24
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,950
 Now we're going to construct a new program which we call

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,525
 harmful for which the Terminator will show fails.

26
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:21,360
 This new program harmful simply has one line.

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,080
 It's just an if, then, else statement.

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,930
 Now we're using this supposed algorithm Terminator as

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,920
 a black box in our harmful algorithm so harmful takes an input J.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,990
 What we do is we run Terminator on this input pair J J.

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,120
 So J is a program and J is the input to the program J.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,020
 And we run Terminator on this pair.

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,175
 If Terminator returns true on this input pair then our program goes to one.

34
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:54,500
 So we get this loop. If Terminator returns false

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 then we simply exit this procedure and we exit the program harmful.
