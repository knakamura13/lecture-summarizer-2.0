1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
 So now we've proven this claim,

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:06,353
 the size of F equals the flow out of L minus the flow in it to L,

3
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:09,175
 and this is true for any flow F,

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,563
 and for any ST cut L,

5
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:13,935
 R. Now, recall we want to show,

6
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:19,339
 that the size of this flow F is at most the capacity of this ST cut L,

7
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,190
 R. And we saw before that this inequality

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,800
 implies that the max flow is at most the min ST cut capacity.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,090
 So, let's see how this claim implies this desired result.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,979
 Well, the size of F equals the flow out of L minus the flow into L,

11
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:37,640
 that's just the claim again.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,480
 Where we can drop this second term,

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,915
 and it only gets bigger.

14
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,070
 So, this is at most the flow out of L. Now,

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,065
 along every edge that leaves the set L,

16
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:51,410
 the flow along that edge has to be at most the capacity of that edge.

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,970
 Therefore, the total flow out of this set L,

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,535
 has to be at most the capacity.

19
00:00:56,535 --> 00:01:00,810
 Because the capacity is defined as the total capacity from the set L to

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,255
 R. We didn't count the edges from R to L. Looking back at our earlier example,

21
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:07,946
 for this ST cut L,

22
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:10,845
 R, the capacity of this cut is 27,

23
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:13,770
 and the total flow along these six edges,

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,687
 which leave this set L,

25
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:20,955
 clearly, must be at most the total capacity along these edges, which is 27.

26
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:25,020
 So, the flow out of this set L has to be at most the capacity of this cut.

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,330
 So, this proves that desired result.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,815
 And therefore, we have that the max flow size is at most the min ST cut capacity.

29
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:35,200
 Now, to complete the proof of the theorem.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,140
 We have to prove the reverse inequality.

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,070
 That the max flow size is at least the min ST cut capacity.

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,070
 Let's dive into that now.
