1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 Once again, our goal is to construct this MST T′,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,320
 which contains X and e*.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,760
 Now, know there is an MST T which contains X.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,250
 Now, there are two cases to consider either this edge e* is a part of T,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,223
 or is not part of T. Now,

6
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:22,281
 the easy case is suppose that e* happens to be part of T then in this case, what is T′?

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:25,915
 T′ is the same as T. There's nothing to do in this case.

8
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:29,990
 Notice we have that X is part of T. And we're

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,745
 supposing that e* happens to be part of T as well. What's our goal?

10
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,450
 Well, our goal is to show a tree,

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,995
 T′ which is an MST while T is an MST.

12
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:46,735
 If we said T′ to be T then we have that T′ is an MST.

13
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:51,280
 And we know that X is part of this T or T′.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,455
 And also e* is part of it.

15
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:57,100
 So we have that XUe* is part of T′.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,715
 So there's nothing to prove in this case.

17
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:00,980
 Done. The hard case is,

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,413
 what if e* is not part of T?

19
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:06,410
 In this particular, example this e* is not part of

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,910
 this particular MST T. So what do we do in this case?

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:17,705
 Well, we have to modify T in order to add edge e* entity and construct a new MST T′.

22
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:20,580
 How do we construct this tree T′ in this case?

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,405
 Well, let's take this tree T which contains X,

24
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,860
 and let's add in the edge e* to it.

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,840
 Let's look at TUe*.

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,600
 We're taking the red edges in this graph and we're adding in this edge e*.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,070
 Let's say that the endpoints of e* are A and B.

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,310
 Now, T is a tree.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,085
 What happens when we add an edge to this tree?

30
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,765
 Well, it creates a cycle.

31
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,560
 It's going to be a cycle which contains this edge.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,840
 Now, this tree contains another path between A and B.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,685
 The path between A and B in the tree T goes along here,

34
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,370
 along the blue edges.

35
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,450
 And then when we add in this edge e*,

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,785
 we get a cycle containing edge e*.

37
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,060
 Let's call this cycle C. Now,

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,915
 I want to drop an edge from this cycle in order to make a tree T′.

39
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:10,970
 We'll show that we can drop any edge from this cycle and we'll have a tree T′.

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,166
 But we want it to be a minimum spanning tree

41
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,640
 so we want the weight of the T′ to be minimum.

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,165
 How do we show there's a minimum weight spanning tree?

43
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:21,490
 Well, we know that the weight of T is minimum.

44
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,920
 If we show that the weight of T′ is in

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,690
 most the weight of T then T′ is also minimum weight.

46
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,375
 We need that to the edge that we drop has weight at least that of e*.

47
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:36,285
 Which of these blue edges has weight which is at least that of e*?

48
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:37,970
 Well, what was special about e*?

49
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,420
 e* was chosen to be the minimum weight edge across this cut S to Sbar.

50
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,780
 In this particular example,

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,385
 there are three other edges,

52
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:49,850
 three other blue edges crossing this cut S to Sbar.

53
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,275
 So what do we know about these three blue edges crossing this cut compared to e*?

54
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,345
 We know that the weight of e2, e3,

55
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,100
 and e4 is at least that of e*.

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,220
 So we can drop any of these three.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,510
 We take any of these three edges,

58
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,915
 let's call it e′, which is in the tree T and which crosses S S-bar.

59
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,440
 Now, in this example once again there are three edges crossing

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,970
 this cut S S-bar which are in this tree T. Now, in general,

61
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,095
 why do we know that there is an edge e′,

62
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:23,225
 which is in the tree T which crosses S S-bar where this edge

63
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:28,450
 e* has one end point in S and one end point in S-bar.

64
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,565
 Now, this tree T it's a tree once again so that means it's connected.

65
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:37,660
 That means there's got to be at least one path between A and B.

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,750
 Now, that path has to cross from S to S-bar at some point.

67
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,950
 In this example, it crosses multiple times,

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,200
 but it's got to cross at least one time from one side to the other side.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,450
 Now, when it crosses from one side to the other side,

70
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,725
 it has to have an edge,

71
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:54,105
 which crosses from one side to the other side.

72
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:55,310
 So take one of those edges,

73
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,684
 which crosses from one side to the other side.

74
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:00,380
 Call that e′. And finally,

75
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,660
 we have our tree T′.

76
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,120
 We're going to set T′ to be T,

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,075
 which is MST, which contains the partial solution X.

78
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,680
 We're going to add in this edge e*,

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,945
 which is the edge we're trying to add into our partial solution.

80
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:16,562
 And then we're going to subtract,

81
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:22,250
 we're going to take away any edge which crosses from S to S-bar,

82
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,095
 which is part of this tree T. And we know there exists at least one such as

83
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:30,710
 e′ take any such edge e′ and take it out of the tree T,

84
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,655
 add in the edge e*,

85
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,630
 and this gives us our tree T′.

86
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,770
 What remains? Well, we've constructed this T′ and now we have to

87
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,465
 prove that T′ is in fact a tree and that is a minimum weight.

88
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:44,465
 Therefore, it's a minimum spanning tree.
