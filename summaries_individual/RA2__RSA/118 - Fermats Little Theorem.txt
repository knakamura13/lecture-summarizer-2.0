Exploring RSA cryptosystem's foundation, focus on Fermat's little theorem: for prime P and any number Z that is 1 ≤ Z ≤ P-1 and GCD(Z,P) = 1, then Z^(P-1) mod P = 1. This theorem's proof hinges on the properties of prime numbers, notably that elements relatively prime to P have multiplicative inverses modulo P. This concept underpins not only RSA but also algorithms for primality testing. The theorem's proof, described as both beautiful and reasonably challenging, leverages the relationship between primes and their inverses. The theorem is distinct from the more complex Fermat's Last Theorem, famously proved by Andrew Wiles centuries after Fermat's initial claim.
