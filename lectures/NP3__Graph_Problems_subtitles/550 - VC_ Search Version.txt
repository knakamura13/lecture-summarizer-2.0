The input to the vertex cover problem is undirected graph G, and the goal which we'll call a budget, little b. Why do we change a terminology from goal to budget? Because instead of trying to find the maximum size clique or independent set, we're trying to find the minimum size vertex cover. The output to the problem is a vertex cover, S, of size at most, little b. We're trying to find the smallest possible, if one exists. And if no such vertex cover exists in the graph G, then we simply output NO. We're going to prove now that the vertex cover problem is NP-complete.
