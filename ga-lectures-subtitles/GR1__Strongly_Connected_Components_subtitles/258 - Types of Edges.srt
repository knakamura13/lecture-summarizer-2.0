1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,455
 Now let's look at a specific edge of the graph.

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:05,620
 Let's say goes from vertex z to vertex w. Now,

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,280
 that edge is going to appear in this graph over here of the DFS tree.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,090
 It's either going to appear as a black edge,

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,655
 an explored edge, or as a blue edge.

6
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,000
 Let's look at the properties of this edge based on whether

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
 it's a black edge or it's a blue edge and what type of blue edge.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,075
 Now, the black edges correspond to explored edges or edges of this tree, this DFS tree.

9
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:28,350
 Notice in this example,

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,660
 the DFS tree happened to be a tree.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,975
 Every vertex happens to be reachable from the vertex B.

12
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,475
 It doesn't have to be the case.

13
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,275
 It could be a forest.

14
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,385
 We could have multiple components here.

15
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:42,540
 So, actually this should be called forest edges, but let's ignore that.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,905
 We call this a DFS tree,

17
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,795
 even though it might be a forest.

18
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,760
 Some examples of these tree edges are B to A,

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,775
 A to D, and so on.

20
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,580
 All of the black edges are tree edges.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,590
 Now, let's look at the properties of the post order numbers for these tree edges.

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,030
 Let's take the example of A to D. So we started exploring from A.

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,920
 Then we saw this neighbor D. So we recursively

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,252
 started exploring from D. We're going to finish off D,

25
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:10,360
 and assign a post order number,

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,635
 and then we're going to pop back to A.

27
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:15,385
 So, A is going to finish after D. So,

28
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:19,920
 the post order number of A is going to be bigger than the post order number of D,

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,750
 because it's going to finish later.

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,380
 And in general, the post order number of the head of this edge is going to be

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,110
 bigger than the post order number of the tail of this edge if it's a tree edge.

32
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,565
 Now, let's look at the blue edges.

33
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,345
 There's going to be three types of blue edges.

34
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:36,215
 Back edges, forward edges, and cross edges.

35
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:41,625
 The examples of back edges in this graph are E to A and F to B.

36
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:45,800
 The edge goes from a descendant to an ancestor.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,330
 So, these are edges that go back up the tree.

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,105
 Now, let's take a specific example. Let's say E to A.

39
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:56,160
 Notice we're going to finish off E before we finish off A.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,185
 So, in this case, the post order number of

41
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,410
 E is going to be smaller than the post order number of A.

42
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,905
 And in general, for back edges,

43
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,610
 the post order number of the head of the edge is going to

44
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,610
 be smaller than the post order number of the tail of the edge.

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,550
 This is opposite for the case of the tree edges.

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,020
 Now, let's look at forward edges.

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,475
 These are going down the tree.

48
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:19,518
 For example D to G. Another example of a forward edge is this edge,

49
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:21,810
 B to E. I forgot to notice this edge earlier when

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,540
 we were running DFS on our earlier example.

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,560
 Now what do you notice about the post order numbers for forward edges?

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,355
 Well, these behave just like tree edges.

53
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:31,650
 Tree edges are going down one depth.

54
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,290
 Forward edges are going down multiple depths.

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,375
 But, they have the same key property,

56
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,640
 that the post order number goes down.

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,065
 Finally, we have cross edges.

58
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:43,560
 For example, F to H and H to G. These are pairs of

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,485
 vertices that have no ancestor descendant relation to each other.

60
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:52,770
 Look at this edge from F to H. H must have been explored before F. Otherwise,

61
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,317
 H would be in the sub tree of F. Since this is an unexplored edge,

62
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,730
 that means that H was finished first,

63
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,110
 so the post order number of H is going to be smaller than the post order number of F. So,

64
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,410
 once again, the post order number goes down with the edge.

65
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,600
 Now, the key property is that for back edges,

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,655
 the post order number goes up.

67
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,148
 For all other edges,

68
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:14,440
 the other three types of edges,

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,690
 tree edges, forward edges,

70
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,570
 and cross edges, the post order number goes down.

71
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,515
 Now, that is the key property that we need for post order numbers.

72
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:21,515
 Back edges behave differently than the other three types of edges.
