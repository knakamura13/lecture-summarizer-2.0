Computing inverses involves the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, taking integers X and Y (X ≥ Y ≥ 0) and outputting integers alpha, beta, and D where D is the GCD of X and Y. Significantly, D equals X*alpha + Y*beta. For an inverse of X mod N to exist, GCD(X, N) must be 1. Running the algorithm with X and N, if D equals 1, indicates an inverse exists. The resulting alpha, where 1 ≡ X*alpha mod N, after simplification (neglecting N*beta as it's 0 mod N), represents the inverse of X mod N. Alpha and beta serve as inverses of X mod Y and Y mod X, respectively, if X and Y are relatively prime.
