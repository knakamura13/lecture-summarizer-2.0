To effectively reduce the colorings problem to SAT, two key functions, f and h, must be established. Function f translates a colorings problem input (graph G and color count k) into a SAT problem input. Conversely, function h converts SAT solutions back to colorings solutions for G and k. Proving the reduction's validity requires demonstrating a bidirectional equivalence: if S satisfies the SAT input generated by f, then h(S) must be a valid coloring of G using k colors; similarly, the absence of a SAT solution should indicate no possible k-coloring for G. This ensures a one-to-one correspondence between colorings problem solutions and their SAT equivalents.
