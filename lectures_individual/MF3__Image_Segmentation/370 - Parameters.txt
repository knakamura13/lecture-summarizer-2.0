The input once again is specified by an undirected graph G where the vertices correspond to the pixels. And in addition, we have the following parameters; for each pixel, we have two parameters, fi and bi. Fi is the likelihood or weight that vertex i, pixel i is in the foreground. And bi is the weight or likelihood that pixel i is in the background. Now, we'll assume that both of these parameters are non-negative. In addition, we're given a parameter for each pair of neighboring pixels. Pij is a separation penalty for this edge. It's the cost of separating i and j into different objects. And once again, we'll assume that pij is not negative.
