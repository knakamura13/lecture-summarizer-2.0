00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,362
 Welcome to Graduate Algorithm's. I'm Eric Vigoda.

2
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:05,040
 This is a theory course and as such,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,260
 it is heavily mathematical in nature.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,190
 Let's take a look at the course outline.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,070
 We'll start with Dynamic Programming,

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,665
 then we'll take a quick look at randomized algorithms,

7
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,350
 including cryptography and hashing.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,665
 Next, we'll look at some more sophisticated divide and conquer examples,

9
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:22,470
 including the beautiful FFT algorithm.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,465
 We'll dive into graph algorithms,

11
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:27,900
 using DFS for connectivity problems on directed graphs.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,820
 And we'll look at a few applications,

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,535
 including the two-step problem,

14
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,990
 and in some sense, the page rank algorithm.

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,860
 Page Rank is the algorithm at the heart of Google's search engine.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,140
 Next, we'll continue with Graph Algorithms,

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,795
 looking at algorithms for the max flow problem.

18
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:44,895
 And then, we'll look at linear programming,

19
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:48,750
 which is a powerful and widely used tool for optimization problems.

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,760
 And finally in the last section of the course,

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,130
 we'll dive into computational complexity.

22
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,870
 We'll explore the theory of NP-Completeness.

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:55,870
 Let's jump into the course. I hope you enjoy it.
