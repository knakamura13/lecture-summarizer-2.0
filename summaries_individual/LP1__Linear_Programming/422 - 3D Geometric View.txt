Maximize LP with obj. func. max x1 + 6x2 + 10x3. Under 7 constraints: 2 demand, 1 supply, 1 packaging, and non-negativity. Geometrical analysis in 3D space reveals feasible region as intersection of 7 half spaces forming convex polyhedron, signifying feasible solutions that meet all constraints. Convexity critical for LP algorithm efficiency. Will apply general LP formulation to determine optimum solution for example given.
