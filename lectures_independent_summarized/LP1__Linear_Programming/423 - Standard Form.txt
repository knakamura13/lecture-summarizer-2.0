Standard linear program form involves maximizing a linear objective function with n variables, x1 to xn, using coefficients c1 to cn. Subject to m constraints, each defined by coefficients a11 to a1n (for the first) up to am1 to amn (for the mth), each less than or equal to values b1 to bm, respectively. Additionally, all n variables must be non-negative. A total of m+n constraints apply, which can be concisely represented with linear algebra.
