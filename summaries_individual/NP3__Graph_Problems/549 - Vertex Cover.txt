A vertex cover in an undirected graph G consists of a subset of vertices that covers every edge, meaning for each edge, at least one of its endpoints is included in the set. This set can be as large as including all vertices, ensuring all edges are covered. For example, if an edge is denoted by (x, y), then either x, y, or both must be in the vertex cover set S. In a given example graph, the red vertices form such a cover.
