To validate flow F in a graph, it's necessary to prove that for each internal vertex (excluding source S and sink T), the inflow equals the outflow. Given that F' is a valid flow from the max flow problem on constructed graph G', inflow equals outflow at each vertex in G'. Mapping this to G, edges from new vertex S' - in G' - to vertex V and original connections U to V remain, where edges out of S' are fully utilized as per F' saturating flow, with edge capacities equal to V's demand. By defining F' as F plus demand on each edge, F's inflow at V equals F's inflow when adjusting for edge demands, as the demands cancel out. Similarly, algebra shows F's outflow at V equals F's outflow. Hence, F's inflow and outflow at V match, verifying F as a valid flow. This demonstrates that a saturating flow F' can be converted to a feasible flow F by adjusting F' for edge demands. The reverse proof remains.
