BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm analysis when applied to flow network at initial flow (zero flow along edges) shows that residual network corresponds to the original network. Running BFS begins at source vertex s, exploring adjacent vertices a, b, and c in sequence, then their subsequent connections which include d, e, and f. A path is formed (s-a-d-t) characterized by its edges connecting vertices whose levels increment by 1, signifying BFS finds the shortest path in terms of edge count from source to target (t). The path's progression observes vertices at levels that correlate to their minimum distance from source s, incrementally rising by 1 per edge; no level skips or regressions being possible due to BFS's layer-by-layer exploration, ensuring the shortest path is found. This level increment consistency is a vital BFS property underlining the reliability of the path established.
