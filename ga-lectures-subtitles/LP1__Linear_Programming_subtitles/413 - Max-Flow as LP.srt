1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
 The input to the max flow problem as

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,215
 a directed graph G along with positive capacities for every edge.

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,625
 Now our linear program is going to have m variables,

4
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,050
 one for every edge.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,840
 Now we're going to have an objective function.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,290
 This is the function that we're trying to optimize.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,940
 This should be a linear function of the variables.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,395
 Now for max flow, we're trying to maximize the size of the flow.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,280
 We measure the size of flow by the flow out of

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,465
 the source vertex or the flow into the sink vertex.

11
00:00:26,465 --> 00:00:29,775
 We'll state it in terms of the flow out of the source vertex,

12
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:33,835
 and thus we're maximizing the total flow out of the source vortex.

13
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:37,328
 So we're summing over edges out of the source vertex S,

14
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,710
 and we're looking at the flow along that edge.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,230
 Now we have some constraints on our variables.

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,800
 For every edge, the flow along that edge has

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,355
 to be non-negative and it needs to satisfy the capacity constraint.

18
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:52,940
 So the flow must be at most the capacity.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,760
 We also have a constraint for every internal vertex,

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,880
 so for every vertex,

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,260
 except for S and T we need that the flow into

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,565
 vertex V must equal the flow out of vertex V. So the flow is conserved.

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,025
 So if we look at the total flow into V,

24
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:12,950
 that needs to match the total flow out of V. Now why is this a linear program?

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,105
 Because the objective function is a max or a min of a linear function of the variables,

26
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:22,320
 and all the constraints are linear functions of the variables.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,610
 What we'll see is that this formulation of the max flow problem is quite powerful.

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,410
 We can easily solve several variants of

29
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:28,410
 the max flow problem with simple modifications to this LP.
