Constructed a graph from a given 3-SAT formula with 4 variables (X, Y, W, Z), creating vertices for each literal in the formula's clauses and adding edges to form triangles for clauses with three literals and a single edge for clauses with two. Variable edges connect each variable to its negated counterpart. Demonstrated that an independent set in the graph (no adjacent vertices) of size four can reflect a satisfying variable assignment for the formula (e.g., X=false, Y=false, W=false), with each chosen vertex in the independent set corresponding to a literal in the formula that reflects a variable's value. Posited a general proof that there's a direct correspondence between independent sets of size m in the graph and satisfying assignments of the formula, meaning each independent set represents a combination of variables that make the original formula true.
