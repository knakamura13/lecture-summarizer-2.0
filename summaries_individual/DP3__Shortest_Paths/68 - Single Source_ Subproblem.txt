Designing a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for the single-source shortest path problem in a directed graph with arbitrary edge weights, positive and negative, but no negative weight cycles. Assume starting at vertex S, needing shortest paths to all other vertices. Each vertex visited only once due to absence of negative cycles. Path P from S to a vertex Z has at most N-1 edges. The DP algorithm conditions on the number of edges: introduce variable I (0 to N-1) indicating the max number of edges allowed in the path. The subproblem, defined by parameters I and Z (Z being a vertex), is to find the function D of I, Z, representing the shortest path length from S to Z using at most I edges. Recurrence is built from I = 0, incrementally up to I = N-1 for the final solution. This implies that the DP approach iteratively expands the number of edges considered to solve the shortest path problem.
