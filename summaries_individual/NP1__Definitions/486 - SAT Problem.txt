The satisfiability (SAT) problem, a seminal NP-complete problem, involves determining if a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) can be satisfied. Given a formula with n variables and m clauses, the task is to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the formula true. If no such assignment exists, the answer is no. An example provided includes a SAT problem with three variables and four clauses, marked as n=3, m=4.
