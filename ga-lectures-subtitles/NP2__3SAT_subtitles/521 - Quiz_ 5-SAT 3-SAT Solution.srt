1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
 The solution is the following.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,445
 I take the first two literals,

3
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:08,670
 X_2_bar or X_3 or Y, the new variable.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,430
 That's the first clause.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,075
 The second clause is the following,

6
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,795
 I take y_bar or X_1_bar,

7
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,370
 the third literal or Z.

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,320
 The last clause is Z_bar or X_4_bar,

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,825
 the fourth literal, or X_5, the fifth literal.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,230
 Instead of formally proving this now,

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,415
 let me give you a quick idea of the proof and then we'll do

12
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:35,880
 the general construction and then we'll prove the general construction is correct.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,475
 Let's suppose that we have a satisfying assignment for C and

14
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:41,970
 let's see how we construct a satisfying assignment for C_prime.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,885
 So, one of these five literals must be satisfied.

16
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,435
 Let's suppose the middle one, X_1_bar is satisfied,

17
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,620
 so X_1 is set to false,

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,295
 so that's going to satisfy the second clause.

19
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,425
 How do we satisfy the first and third clause?

20
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,920
 Well, here we use these auxiliary variables,

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,900
 setting Y to true satisfies

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,125
 the first clause and setting Z to false satisfies the last clause.

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,950
 And in general, one of these five is going to be satisfied,

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,705
 that's going to satisfy one of these three clauses.

25
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:14,155
 And then we can use these other two auxiliary variables to satisfy the other two clauses.

26
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,520
 How about the reverse implication?

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,070
 Suppose we have a satisfying of assignment for _prime,

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,285
 how do we get a satisfying assignment for C?

29
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:23,050
 Well, take the case where Y is false,

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,360
 so this literal is not satisfied so,

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,685
 one of these two literals must be satisfied.

32
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:29,735
 If one of these two literals is satisfied,

33
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,270
 they're satisfied here as well,

34
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,765
 so C is satisfied.

35
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:35,335
 Now, suppose that Z is set to true,

36
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:39,015
 then this literal Z_bar is not satisfied.

37
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,025
 So, one of these two literals must be satisfied,

38
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:45,470
 either X_4 is set to false or X_5 is set to true,

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,620
 in which case, one of these last two literals of C is satisfied.

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,220
 The last case is a complement of these two.

41
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,690
 Y is set to true and Z is set to false.

42
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,410
 Well, since we're taking a satisfying assignment for C_prime,

43
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,850
 look at how this second clause can be satisfied.

44
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,565
 Y is set to true and Z is set to false so these two literals are not satisfied.

45
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:11,650
 So the only way to satisfy this clause is to set X_1 to false.

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,495
 So if X_1 is set to false,

47
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:17,200
 then we satisfy this third literal in C. Now,

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
 let's do the general construction.

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,330
 Let's say we have a clause of size K. Now we're going to create

50
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,950
 a series of clauses which is equivalent to this original clause.

51
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,645
 Now when we had a clause of size four,

52
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:31,700
 we added one new variable and we had a pair of clauses.

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,520
 When we had a clause of size five,

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,110
 we created two new variables and then we have a triple of clauses.

55
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,830
 Now, if we have a clause of size K,

56
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,216
 we're going to create a K minus

57
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:46,255
 three new variables and we're going to create K minus two clauses.

58
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:46,255
 So, let's go ahead and do the general construction.
