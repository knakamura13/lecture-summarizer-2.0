1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
 We're looking first at this recurrence,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,970
 T(n) = 4T (n/2) +O (n).

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,010
 Let's start by getting rid of the big O notation.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,236
 Order n means that there's some constant c so that t of n

5
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:16,524
 is almost 4 times T of n over 2 plus cn.

6
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:19,650
 So we replaced order n by most cn.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,265
 We also have the base case,

8
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:24,030
 let's say the base cases of size 1 since

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,384
 the inputs of size 1 it must solve in order one time.

10
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:30,180
 So we can place that order 1 by a constant c and

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,390
 notice we can use the same constant c for both of these by taking

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,315
 the max of these two constants and calling that c.

13
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:40,095
 Let's solve for T of n. So I simply restated the recurrence,

14
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,703
 though for convenience I rearranged the terms so T of n

15
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:47,685
 is the most c times n plus 4T of n and over 2.

16
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:51,278
 Now let's replace T of n over 2 by this recurrence.

17
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:56,070
 So replace n by n over 2 so we get this term c times n again

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,800
 plus we get 4 times and then let's replace T of n over 2 with this expression.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,010
 So we have 4 times T of and we're placing n by n over 2 so we get n over

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,030
 2 squared and then for the last term we're

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,228
 replacing n by n over 2 so instead of c times n,

22
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:16,245
 we get c times n over 2.

23
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:19,455
 Now let's rearrange this and it collects similar terms.

24
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:25,350
 So we want to collect c times n with 4 times c times n over 2.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,360
 So these have a common factor of c times n,

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,685
 this term is 1,

27
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:34,470
 this term is 4 over 2 times c times n and then finally,

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,880
 the last term is 4 squared times T of n over two squared.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,640
 Now let's repeat this process and replace T of n over 4 by this expression.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,205
 Now we're replacing n by n over 2 squared.

31
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:51,570
 So the first term becomes 4T of n over

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,985
 2 cubed and the last term becomes c times n over two squared.

33
00:01:56,985 --> 00:02:00,780
 Rearranging once again so bringing this term over here.

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,540
 So we have T of n is the most c times n times the quantity 1 plus 4

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,810
 halves plus 4 halves squared plus 4 cubed times T of n and over 2 cubed.

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:12,810
 Notice we're starting to get a geometric series here.
