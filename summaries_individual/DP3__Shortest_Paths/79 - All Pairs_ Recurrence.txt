Two scenarios for a path from S to T: directly connected by an edge or not. If connected, shortest path D(0, S, T) equals edge length W(ST). If not, shortest path without intermediates is infinite. For allowed intermediates 1 through I, we seek D(I, S, T). We define a recurrence to express D(I, S, T) in terms of smaller I values. Two cases: path includes I as the last vertex or it doesn't. If it doesn't include I, we examine this simpler scenario first.
