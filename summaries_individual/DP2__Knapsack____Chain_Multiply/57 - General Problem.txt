N matrices A1 to An must be multiplied, with matrix Ai being of dimension Mi-1 x Mi. The task is to find the least costly multiplication sequence, cost being dependent solely on matrix dimensions, not their contents. Required input: the dimensions (N+1 parameters) of N matrices. Identifying the minimum cost precedes determining the actual multiplication sequence (parenthesization) that achieves this cost.
