1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 Let's first look at the proof for the diagonal entries.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,515
 So let's look at the product of these two matrices,

3
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:10,790
 capital M parameterized by omega sub n inverse

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,130
 and capital M parameterized by

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,345
 omega sub n. And we want to show that the diagonal entries,

6
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:20,315
 so the entries k, k equal n. First off,

7
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,340
 let's recall what this matrix capital M is.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,305
 So capital M parameterized by omega sub n is this matrix.

9
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:31,245
 This is what we saw before when we analyzed FFT.

10
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:36,110
 Now this matrix capital M parameterized by omega sub n inverse is

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,920
 just this same matrix with omega sub n replaced by omega sub n to the negative 1.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,550
 So we get this matrix here.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,030
 Now we're looking at the entry k,

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,615
 k. So when you take the kth row and the kth column.

15
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,150
 The kth row of this matrix is the vector

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,400
 1 omega sub n to the negative k and then powers up to

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,480
 omega sub n to the negative n minus 1 times k.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,430
 The kth column of this matrix is this vector the entry k,

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,105
 k in the product matrix is the dot product of these two vectors.

20
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:17,070
 First term is one and then we do omega sub n to negative k times

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,600
 omega sub n to the k. This is the same as omega sub n to the 0, which is 1.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,570
 So this term is 1.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,935
 And similarly the third term is also 1.

24
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:31,250
 All the terms are 1. How many terms are there?

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,250
 There's n terms. So we get n. So we proved what we want for the diagonal entry.
