The Clique problem is established as NP-complete by first demonstrating that it belongs to the NP class through polynomial-time verification of proposed solutions. Validation involves checking if a subset of vertices, S, in a given graph G forms a clique of size at least g, by assessing whether each vertex pair is connectedâ€”an operation that takes O(n^3) time with a simple algorithm but can be reduced to O(n^2). The second proof element shows that the Clique problem is at least as hard as any NP problem by reducing an NP-complete problem to it. The similar graph-based Independent set problem, which is NP-complete, is selected for this reduction, thereby confirming the Clique problem's NP-completeness.
