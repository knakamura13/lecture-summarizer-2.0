Analyzing the likelihood of a Jth clause being satisfied shows it is 1 minus the product of 1-YI hat star for I=1 to K. Using the AM-GM inequality, the geometric mean (negated) is at least the arithmetic mean of these 1 minus YI hat star terms. After simplification, the sum of constants (1) cancels out with 1/K, and it's combined with the sum of YI hat stars, all raised to the K power. The prior linear program constraint indicated the sum of the Y variables must be at least a certain real number Z if they are set to false. This information allows replacing the sum of the YI hat stars with ZJ hat star, showing that the probability the clause is satisfied is at least 1 minus (1 - ZJ hat star / K) to the K power. This expression still contains the ZJ hat star within the K power, indicating a need for calculus to further simplify the expression.
