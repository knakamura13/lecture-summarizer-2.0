1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
 Now, let's formulate this problem as a linear program.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,315
 Now, we're going to have three variables X1, X2, X3,

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,940
 corresponding to how much we produce of A,

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,370
 and B, and C, respectively, per day.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,250
 Now, our goal is to maximize the profit.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,835
 So, our objective function is going to mean maximize X1

7
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:22,405
 plus 6 X2 plus 10X3 based on our profit assumption.

8
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,300
 Now, we have two demand constraints.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,235
 X1 is at most 300 and X2 is at most 200.

10
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,235
 Now, we have one supply constraint,

11
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:37,280
 X1 plus 3X2 plus 2X3 is at most 1000.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,910
 And finally, the packaging constraint says that X2 plus 3X3 is at most 500.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,685
 And let's not forget the non-negativity constraints.

14
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:46,685
 X1, X2, X3 all have to be non-negative.
