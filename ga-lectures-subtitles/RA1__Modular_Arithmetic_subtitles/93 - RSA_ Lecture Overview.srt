00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
 Let me give you an overview of the topics that we're gonna study in this lecture.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,450
 Now the mathematics of the RSA cryptosystem are very

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,595
 beautiful and they're fairly simple once you have the right mathematical background.

4
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:15,150
 So we're going to start with a short primer on the mathematical topics that we need.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,380
 The relevant topic that we need is Modular Arithmetic.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,740
 Some of you may have seen this before,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,595
 so it might be a reveal, for others it's fairly simple to learn.

8
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:25,935
 Then one key concept that we need are multiplicative inverses,

9
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,385
 and what they mean in modular arithmetic.

10
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:30,750
 And then we're gonna look at Euclid's GCD algorithm,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,605
 greatest common divisor, which is gonna be used in the RSA cryptosystem.

12
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:38,690
 Next we're going to learn about Fermat's Little Theorem and it's

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,465
 the key tool in the design of the RSA algorithm.

14
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:45,910
 So at this point we'll be able to detail the RSA algorithm.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,675
 Finally, we'll look at Primality testing, given a number,

16
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:52,165
 can we test whether the number is prime or not, or composite?

17
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:55,110
 Once we see how to do that using Fermat's Little Theorem,

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,275
 then we're going to be able to generate random primes.

19
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:02,305
 Generating random primes is a key component in the RSA algorithm.

20
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:03,480
 So once we complete that,

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,330
 we'll have completed our discussion of the RSA algorithm.

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,330
 Now let's go ahead and dive into the algorithms related to the RSA.
