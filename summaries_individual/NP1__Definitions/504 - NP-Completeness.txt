P is hypothesized to not equal NP, indicating that a set of problems exists outside the class P (solvable in polynomial time), which are termed intractable or NP-complete. These NP-complete problems are the hardest within class NP and cannot be solved in polynomial time if P â‰  NP. If it's shown that even one NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, it would imply that P = NP, meaning all NP problems could be solved in polynomial time. Demonstrating this equivalence requires showing that a polynomial time solution for one NP-complete problem (like 'set') could be used to solve all other problems in NP efficiently. This entails proving that all problems in NP can be reduced to the NP-complete problem 'set', and solving it in polynomial time would enable solving all NP problems similarly. More precise details will be elaborated in subsequent slides.
