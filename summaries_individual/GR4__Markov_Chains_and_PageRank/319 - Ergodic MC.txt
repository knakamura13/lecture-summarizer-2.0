Ergodic Markov chains, characterized by being aperiodic and irreducible, possess a unique stationary distribution π. Aperiodicity is ensured by adding self-loops to prevent the graph from being bipartite, while irreducibility requires a fully connected graph where all state pairs are reachable in one step. When a Markov chain is both aperiodic and irreducible, any power T of the transition matrix will yield rows consisting entirely of π, signifying that from any starting state, the chain converges to π after T steps. PageRank applies this principle by treating the internet as a web graph where pages are states and hyperlinks between them as edges. To conform to the necessary ergodic properties, self-loops are added and full connectivity is ensured. PageRank is represented by the unique stationary distribution of this ergodic chain, indicating the relative importance of a webpage based on the likelihood that a long random walk ends at that page.
