Euler's Theorem states for N = PQ (P, Q = prime), if Z and N are coprime (GCD(Z, N) = 1), then Z^(phi(N)) = 1 mod N, where phi(N) = (P-1)(Q-1). This is foundational for RSA encryption. RSA uses prime pair P, Q to create N and leverages (P-1)(Q-1) to generate encryption and decryption keys, enabling secure message exchange. The theorem underpins the fundamental mechanism of RSA's cryptographic process.
