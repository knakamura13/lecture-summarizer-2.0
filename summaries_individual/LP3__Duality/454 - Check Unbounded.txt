To determine if a linear program (LP) in canonical form is unbounded, first establish its feasibility by adding a variable Z, changing the constraint to \(AX + Z \leq B\), and ensuring a non-negative Z exists for a solution. If feasible, assess the feasibility of the dual LP. If the dual is infeasible, given the LP is feasible, it implies the LP is unbounded. This process involves two steps: confirming the primal LPâ€™s feasibility and then testing the infeasibility of its dual. The weak duality theorem indicates if the dual is infeasible, the primal must either be unbounded or infeasible, but does not differentiate between these scenarios; hence, the necessity of the earlier feasibility check for the primal LP.
