Trees in graph theory: connected acyclic graphs. Example provided: a graph with 17 vertices and 16 edges, demonstrating a basic property that any tree with 'n' vertices has 'n - 1' edgesâ€”minimum to connect all vertices without forming cycles. Another property: exactly one path between any two vertices, ensuring graph is both connected and acyclic. To prove a sub-graph is a tree for a cut property proof: demonstrate it's connected and has 'n - 1' edges. This proof combines the connection requirement with the edge count property.
