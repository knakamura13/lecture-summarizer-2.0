1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,817
 Now let's formally define the Halting Problem.

2
00:00:02,817 --> 00:00:05,526
 The input to the halting problem is a program P,

3
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:10,525
 with an input I for that program P. Now how is this program P given to you?

4
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:12,800
 Well, we can restrict it to any language we want.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,526
 We can say it's in pseudocode,

6
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,660
 we can say it's in C, Python,

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,110
 but we can say it's in an arbitrary language.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,145
 Now what is the output of the halting problem?

9
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,775
 Well, think of the basic task of a compiler.

10
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,755
 Given a program and an input,

11
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:29,295
 we want to figure out if this program terminates on this input,

12
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,555
 or does it have an infinite loop.

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,550
 That's the task of the halting problem,

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,940
 to figure out whether this program on

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,075
 this particular input runs forever, or ever terminates.

16
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:43,835
 So if the program P on input I ever terminate,

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,145
 so it stops eventually, then we output true.

18
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:49,665
 We're not trying to figure out whether it runs correctly,

19
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:52,710
 whether it gives a correct solution on this input.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,560
 We're just asking whether the program P ever stops when we run it on input I.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,090
 On the other side we output false if the program P on input I never terminates.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,945
 In other words, it has an infinite loop.

23
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:09,020
 To summarize, I'm giving you a particular program P,

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,770
 and a specific input I,

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,775
 and on this specific input I,

26
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,355
 does the program P have an infinite loop?

27
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:15,355
 Or does it eventually stop?
