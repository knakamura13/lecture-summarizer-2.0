Examining the dynamic programming algorithm's recurrence reveals a complex table-filling method targeted at computing the upper diagonal of a two-dimensional table C, where the entry indices satisfy j ≥ i. Begin by populating the base case, C(i, i), the table's diagonal. The following step involves filling the off-diagonal entries, C(i, i+1), which rely exclusively on the previously computed diagonal entries. Subsequently, address C(i, i+2), using both diagonal and off-diagonal entries for computations. The final calculation is for C(1, n), which yields the minimum cost to multiply matrices from A_1 to A_n. The algorithm progresses methodically from the diagonal, moving to entries with greater index differences. This difference, termed the width S, signifies the relative distance from the diagonal (with base cases at width S=0). It then increases in increments—S=1 for off-diagonals, and so on—up to S=n-1, covering the table in stages determined by S. This structure will guide the pseudocode detailing for the dynamic programming algorithm.
