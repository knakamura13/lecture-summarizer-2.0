1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,885
 Now, let's dive into the proof that the independent set problem is NP-complete.

2
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:07,350
 The first step we have to show is that this problem,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,870
 the Independent-set problem lies in the class NP.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,210
 To do this, we need to show that we can verify solutions in polynomial time.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,905
 So given an input to the independent-set problem,

6
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:22,830
 this is specified by a graph G and the goal little g and given

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,195
 a proposed solution S. We need to verify that

8
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:30,015
 S is in fact the solution to the independent-set problem on this input.

9
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,725
 In order n squared time,

10
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:35,445
 we can consider all pairs of vertices in this subset S.

11
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:39,570
 And we can check that this pair of vertices x and y are not adjacent.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,325
 There's not an edge x,

13
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:43,195
 y in the input graph.

14
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:46,275
 Once we check this for all pairs of vertices in S,

15
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:48,450
 then we know that there are no edges contained in

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,390
 the set S and therefore S is an independent set.

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,830
 And finally in order n time,

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,310
 we can check the size of S and see that the size of S is at least g, our goal.

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,715
 If those two statements are true,

20
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:04,580
 then we know that our proposed solution S is in fact a solution to this input.

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,005
 That proves that the independent-set problem is in the class NP.

22
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,950
 Next, we have to show that the independent-set problem is at least as

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,160
 hard as every problem in the class NP. How do we do that?

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,800
 Well, we take something which is known to be at least as hard as

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,355
 everything in the class NP such as SAT or 3SAT,

26
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:25,220
 and we show a reduction from that known NP-complete problem to this new problem.

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,315
 We're going to show a reduction from the 3SAT problem to the independent-set problem.

28
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,140
 Why consider a 3SAT instead of SAT?

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,355
 Well, 3SAT is just easier.

30
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:34,545
 It's a simpler problem.

31
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:37,635
 We know that all the clauses are of size one, two, or three.

32
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:38,895
 If we consider a SAT,

33
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:41,620
 then the clauses are of arbitrary size.

34
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:41,620
 Now, let's look at the reduction from 3SAT to the independent-set.
