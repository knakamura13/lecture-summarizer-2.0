To ensure flow conservation at each vertex (excluding S' and T') under flow F', it's checked against the original flow F, where inflow equals outflow at any vertex V. F' is defined by setting the flow from S' to meet V's demand and adjusting other inflows (U to V) by subtracting the demand on that edge. Both adjustments negate the effect of V's total demand, equating the total inflow under F and F'. A similar process confirms that outflow under F' equals outflow under F at V. Consequently, as inflow equals outflow for vertex V under F and these conditions hold under F', flow F' is validated as a feasible flow.
