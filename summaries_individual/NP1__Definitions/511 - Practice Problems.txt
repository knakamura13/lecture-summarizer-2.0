Understand P, NP classes and reductions concept. Upcoming examples will demonstrate proofs that a problem is NP-complete; expected unfamiliarity with the process. Suggested practice includes the first two problems in Chapter 8, Dasgupta et al. textbook, focusing on reductions between optimization and search problems, and between search and decision problems. Next lecture plans to prove three set is NP-complete using set NP proof.
