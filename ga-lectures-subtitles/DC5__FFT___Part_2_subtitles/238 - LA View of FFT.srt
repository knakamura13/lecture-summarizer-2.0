00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
 We just saw this linear algebra view of the evaluation of

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,130
 this polynomial of A(x) at these end points x knot through xN-1.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,040
 Now let's look at it for the perspective of FFT.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,600
 For FFT, these n points correspond to the nth roots of unity.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,300
 So let x of j be the jth of the nth roots of unity.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,615
 So it's omega sub n to the jth power. Now let's rewrite these vectors and matrices.

7
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:30,300
 Replacing these n points by the nth root of unity we have now A(1),

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,375
 A of omega sub n and so on up to A of omega sub n to the n minus 1 power.

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,335
 So these are the nth width of unity.

10
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:43,020
 This column vector is going to stay the same it's still going

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,020
 to be the coefficients of this polynomial A(x).

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,300
 Now let's look at the rows of this matrix.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,850
 Now the first of the roots of unity is 1,

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,375
 so the first row are the powers of it so it's just going to be one.

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,148
 The second row are going to be powers of omega sub n.

16
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:01,630
 This in fact are just the nth roots of unity.

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,260
 The third row is going to be one omega sub n square,

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,845
 omega sub n to the fourth and so on up to omega sub n to the two times n minus one.

19
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:15,255
 It's just the powers of omega sub n square.

20
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:19,200
 The last row are going to be the powers of this last root of unity.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,100
 So it's going to be 1 omega sub n to the n-1 and so on.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,660
 The last term is omega sub n to the n-1 times n-1.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,300
 Now what's important thing to notice about this matrix.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,895
 Well, first off it's symmetric,

25
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:35,040
 the entry IJ is the same as the entry JI,

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,290
 so it's probably going to have some nice properties.

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,200
 The other thing to notice is that it's just a function of

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,200
 omega sub n. The entries of this matrix are just powers of omega.
