General reduction from Max-SAT to integer linear programming (ILP) involves maximizing satisfied clauses. ILP uses binary variables Zj for each clause, representing satisfaction (1 if satisfied, 0 if not). Additionally, ILP includes binary variables Yi, linked to formula variables, restricted between 0 and 1. The objective is to maximize sum of Zj (satisfied clauses) under constraints that mirror clause satisfaction conditions. For clauses, if positive literals are unsatisfied due to corresponding Yi being 0, or negative literals are unsatisfied when Yi is 1, Zj must be 0, indicating clause dissatisfaction. If any literal is satisfied, Zj can be 1. As the goal is maximization, Zj will take 1 whenever possible. With constraints ensuring Yi and Zj are integers, this formulates an N+M dimensional ILP, which is an exact equivalent to the original Max-SAT problem.
