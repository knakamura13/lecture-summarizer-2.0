Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are guaranteed to have at least one source vertex (no incoming edges) and one sink vertex (no outgoing edges). The presence of a source is confirmed by observing the first vertex in any topological ordering, as it cannot have any incoming edges due to the unilateral left-to-right direction of edges in such an ordering. The vertex with the highest post-order number in a DAG is always a source. Conversely, the last vertex in a topological ordering must be a sink since no edges can leave it without violating the specified direction; hence, the lowest post-order numbered vertex in a DAG will be a sink. An alternative method for topological sorting involves repeatedly finding and removing sink vertices from a graph and is a prelude to addressing topological sorting in more general directed graphs. This alternative algorithm reverses the process by outputting vertices from end (sink) to beginning (source), which is a process applicable to general directed graphs, the next subject of focus.
