1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,662
 We now have a new subproblem formulation,

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:04,770
 let L of i denote the length of

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,760
 the longest increasing subsequence on the first i elements of

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,370
 the input array a_1 through a_i and which includes a_i itself.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,330
 This is the extra restriction that we added into our subproblem formulation, okay?

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,345
 It requires that a_i is included in the subsequences that you consider.

7
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:28,245
 Now, it will be straightforward to express a recurrence,

8
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:32,715
 which formulates L of i in terms of L_1 through L_i minus one.

9
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,790
 Let's go back and look at our earlier example and now we'll see,

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,220
 the straightforward recurrence that arises.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,115
 Here is our earlier example.

12
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:43,920
 And let's look at L for this new subproblem formulation.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,730
 In this case, L of one is one because we're looking at the length of

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,370
 the longest increasing subsequence on an input of size

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,965
 one just five itself and it has to include five.

16
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:59,040
 Then for i equals two with length two from the subsequent five, seven.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,760
 Now, we start to see a difference when i equals three.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,747
 What is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in five,

19
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:07,538
 seven, four which includes four?

20
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:10,090
 That's just four itself.

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,440
 So that's length of one, okay?

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,730
 Recall in our earlier definition of L,

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,320
 it was length, it was three this entry.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,605
 Once again, for i equals four,

25
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:23,670
 L of four is one because of minus three.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,070
 So i equals five, now,

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,905
 the length is three from five, seven, nine.

28
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,875
 For i equals six,

29
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,190
 the length is two from minus three one,

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,135
 for i is equals seven,

31
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:41,290
 the length is four from five, seven, nine, ten.

32
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,945
 Finally, let's look at the case i equals

33
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:51,270
 10 which is the case which caused the problems in the earlier definition of L. Now,

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,510
 in this case, we want to see which subproblems allow us to append A on to the end of it.

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,824
 I notice a can be appended on to subsequences ending at five, seven,

36
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:03,930
 four minus three but nine,

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,405
 it cannot get appended on to, that won't be increasing.

38
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:09,690
 It cannot get appended on to 10 either.

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,655
 But the others allow it to be appended on to the end.

40
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:17,600
 So, we're going to take the longest of those and

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,990
 we're going to add plus one for adding eight on to the end of it.

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,565
 So whatever is the longest increasing subsequence ending at five,

43
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:29,155
 we can append eight on to the end of it.

44
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,305
 We don't have to know the subsequence itself.

45
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:34,020
 We just have to know, it's of length four and

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,110
 it ends at five and then we can append A on to the end.

47
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,875
 We obtain the sequence of length five,

48
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,520
 therefore, L of 10 is five.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,530
 Now, this highlights the recurrence for the solution of L of i,

50
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:47,530
 in terms of smaller subproblems L_one through L minus one, i minus one
