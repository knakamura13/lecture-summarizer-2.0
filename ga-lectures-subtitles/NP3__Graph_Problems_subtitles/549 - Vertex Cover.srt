00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,529
 What exactly is a vertex cover?

2
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,250
 Let's formally define it.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,610
 Once again, we're going to consider undirected graph G. Here's an example graph.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,330
 A subset of vertices is a vertex cover,

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,515
 if, it covers every edge.

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,338
 The red vertices in this graph,

7
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:18,150
 our vertex cover for the graph G. What

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,455
 exactly does it mean that the set S covers every edge?

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,118
 Well, if you look at this example,

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:25,338
 for every edge, such as this edge,

11
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:28,045
 at least one of the two endpoints is in the red set,

12
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,500
 is in the vertex cover.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,370
 For this edge, one endpoint is in.

14
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,660
 For this edge, both endpoints are in the red set.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,815
 Formally, to cover every edge,

16
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:39,865
 we mean that for every edge of the graph.

17
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:46,990
 Say x, y, either endpoint x is in the set S and/or y is in the set S. So,

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,901
 both end points can be in there,

19
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,030
 or at least one of the endpoints is in there.

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,650
 Now it's easy to find a large vertex cover.

21
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,115
 For instance, I can include all the vertices in the vertex cover.

22
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:57,115
 And, this is a large vertex cover for this graph.
