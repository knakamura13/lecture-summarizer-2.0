Vertex cover S implies that its complement, S bar, is an independent set. Demonstrated this by showing that in graph edges, at least one endpoint is always part of the vertex cover S, ensuring that the complement S bar consists of non-adjacent vertices. Since S bar doesn't include both vertices of any edge, it qualifies as an independent set, as no two vertices within it share an edge.
