1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 Now les take a look at what it means for an LP to be unbounded.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,530
 This means that the optimal value of the objective function is arbitrarily large.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,305
 Let's take a look at an example of an unbounded LP.

4
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:11,625
 Let's look at the following LP.

5
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,785
 We have two variables x and y,

6
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:18,360
 we're maximizing x plus y subject to the following constraints,

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,640
 x minus y is at most 1,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,970
 x plus 5y is at least three.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,365
 And then we have the non negativity constraints.

10
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,925
 Let's take a look at the feasible region for this LP.

11
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:32,087
 Here's the feasible region based on the non-negativity constraints.

12
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:33,660
 We're in the upper right quadrant.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,405
 The first constraint x minus y is at most one,

14
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:40,420
 defines this half space and x plus 5y is at least three,

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,395
 defines this upper half space.

16
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:46,170
 And this colored region are the feasible points.

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,760
 Now the picture is truncated at y equals five

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,890
 but actually this feasible region is unbounded set.

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,910
 Now let's look at this objective function x plus y.

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,600
 What we've illustrated here are the heat map and the level

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,670
 set for this object to function x plus y.

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,820
 So the blue regions are the lower values of

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,330
 this objective function and as we get up to the red regions,

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,875
 we get the higher values of this objective function.

25
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:12,030
 So notice the objective function is increasing as we move up.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,520
 And we've also illustrated the level sets so we look at x plus

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,830
 y equals c for different values of c. So here c equals two,

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,315
 c equals four and as we keep going up,

29
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,260
 we get larger values of this objective function.

30
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,833
 And once again, the picture is truncated y equals five,

31
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,055
 but the feasible set is unbounded.

32
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:33,290
 So we get unbounded values of feasible points x, y.

33
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,090
 For unbounded values of c. Now one important point is the fact that this LP is unbounded,

34
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,115
 is a function of this objective function.

35
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,700
 The optimal value for this objective function is

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,455
 achieved in this unbounded region of this feasible region.

37
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,940
 Now there could be some objective functions

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,060
 where their optimum are achieved at these vertices.

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,060
 Let's take a look at such an example.
